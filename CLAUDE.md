## About This File
This is the **CLAUDE.md** for the project — automatically loaded by Claude Code at the start of every session. It serves as the single source of truth for project context, conventions, and current status.
**Update rule:** When significant decisions are made or features are completed, update this file to keep it current.
**Reminder rule:** After completing a major task or feature, remind the user to:
1. Update CLAUDE.md (offer to do it)
2. Commit and push to GitHub (offer to do it, confirm `.env` is not tracked)
-----
## Workflow Rules

### Planning
- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions). Write the plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity. Check in with the user before starting implementation.
- **State assumptions explicitly.** Before implementing any non-trivial feature, list your assumptions (data availability, API contract, column names, user workflow, external service behavior). If uncertain about any, ask — don't guess silently. (See lessons.md: NotebookLM API, sort order, registry format — all caused by silent assumptions.)
- **Surface ambiguity.** If a requirement could have 2+ interpretations, present all of them and ask the user to pick. Don't silently choose one. Example: "Add export" could mean API endpoint, file download, or background job — name the options.

### Coding Discipline (adapted from Karpathy's principles)

**These four principles are binding for all non-trivial work. For obvious one-liners, use judgment.**

**1. Think Before Coding — Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**
- State your assumptions before writing code. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- **For third-party integrations:** Install the package, inspect the API surface (`dir()`, `inspect.signature()`), write a minimal test BEFORE writing production code. Never code against a guessed interface.

**2. Simplicity First — Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- **Prefer files over infrastructure.** Before adding a database table, cache layer, or new storage format, verify you can't solve it with existing files (JSON, JSONL, CSV in `data/`) + in-process query.
- **Litmus test:** "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

**3. Surgical Changes — Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused. Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- **The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

**4. Goal-Driven Execution — Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
  - "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
  - "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
  - "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification per step:
  ```
  1. [Step] → verify: [check]
  2. [Step] → verify: [check]
  3. [Step] → verify: [check]
  ```
- Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

### Execution
- **Subagents:** Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents. One task per subagent for focused execution. Keep main context window clean. **Quality gate:** Every subagent prompt must include (a) a written spec (what to do and why), (b) success criteria (3 items), (c) known constraints (specific modules, APIs, files to use). No blank-check subagents. When a subagent writes cross-module imports, verify function names exist (`grep "def function_name" target_module.py`).
- **Simplicity first:** Make every change as simple as possible. Minimal impact. Only touch what's necessary.
- **No laziness:** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Autonomous bug fixing:** When given a bug report: (1) reproduce it with a test, (2) find the root cause (check `tasks/lessons.md` for related patterns), (3) fix it. If the bug might be systemic (affects other companies, other endpoints), flag it before patching — don't silently fix one instance.

### Verification
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works — run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.
- **Test-first by default.** Before implementing: write the test for the happy path. Implementation is done when that test passes. Then add 2-3 edge-case tests. For financial functions, include at least one test with a non-1.0 FX multiplier.
- When a task depends on external data (tape edits, DB migrations), **verify the data first** before updating code that references it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

### Self-Improvement
- After ANY correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern. Write rules that prevent the same mistake.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start for this project.

### Progress Tracking
- Track plans and progress in `tasks/todo.md`. Mark items complete as you go.
- Explain changes with high-level summaries at each step.
- After completing a major task, add a review section to `tasks/todo.md` and capture lessons.

### NotebookLM Connectivity
**NotebookLM is a first-class research engine.** Before any task involving data room research, memo generation, or company analysis:
1. Check NLM status: `GET /notebooklm/status` — verify `authenticated: true`
2. If `authenticated: false`: remind the user to run `notebooklm login` in the venv, then restart the backend
3. For new companies: create an NLM notebook and sync dataroom PDFs after ingestion
4. The NLM bridge auto-recovers: if auth file appears (user runs `notebooklm login`), the next NLM call within 5 minutes will detect it and re-enable dual-engine research
5. **Never silently skip NLM** — if it's unavailable, warn the user with the fix instructions

### Analysis Framework Authority
**The Analysis Framework (`core/ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md`) is the authoritative source for ALL analytical decisions.** It is the "brain" of the platform — not just documentation, but the specification that drives every metric, dashboard, and AI prompt.

**Binding rules:**
- For any analytical decision (new metric, new company, methodology change), consult the framework FIRST
- Its hierarchy (L1–L5), denominator discipline, three clocks, and separation principle are non-negotiable
- New companies MUST be onboarded via `/onboard-company` which enforces framework compliance
- New metrics/tabs MUST be added via `/extend-framework` which propagates across all layers
- Periodic health checks via `/framework-audit` ensure no drift from the framework

**Quick reference:** `core/FRAMEWORK_INDEX.md` — fast lookup of sections, commands, existing companies, and core principles.

**Framework commands available:**
| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/onboard-company` | Adding a new company or product to the platform |
| `/add-tape` | Adding a new tape file for an existing company |
| `/validate-tape` | Running data quality checks on any tape |
| `/framework-audit` | Periodic audit of all companies against the framework |
| `/extend-framework` | Adding new metrics, tabs, or analytical capabilities |
| `/methodology-sync` | Verifying methodology page matches backend code |
| `/company-health` | Quick diagnostic of any company's analytical coverage |
| `/eod` | End-of-session cleanup (tests, docs, commit, push) |

## What This Project Is
**Laith** (with **AI** as a play in the name) — an institutional-grade, full-stack web application for analyzing and monitoring asset-backed loan portfolios. Built for a private credit fund (ACP) that purchases receivables and short-term loans from portfolio companies.
The platform allows analysts and investment committee members to:
- Upload loan tape snapshots (CSV/Excel) and explore portfolio performance
- Run automated data integrity checks across snapshots
- View interactive dashboards with 18 analysis tabs (including institutional risk analytics, loss attribution, and forward-looking signals)
- Explore the Analysis Framework — a structured analytical philosophy guiding all metrics
- Generate AI-powered portfolio commentary and ask natural language questions about the data
- Generate AI-powered IC investment memos with data room research integration
- Query documents across data rooms using dual-engine research (Claude + NotebookLM)
-----
## Branding
- **Platform name:** Laith (لَيث — Arabic for "lion"; the AI in L-**AI**-th is intentional)
- **Logo:** Styled text logo built into components (gold "AI" highlight in "LAITH" + 🦁 icon mark)
- **Logo component:** `LaithLogo` exported from `Navbar.jsx`, used in Navbar (Home page removed duplicate)
- **Page title:** `Laith — Data Analytics` (set in `frontend/index.html` and Navbar)
- **Note:** Original SVG at `frontend/public/logo.svg` has white background, not suitable for dark theme. Using styled component instead.
-----
## Business Context
**Who uses it:** Sharif (fund analyst/PM) and eventually the broader investment committee.
**Current portfolio companies:**
- **Klaim** — medical insurance claims factoring, UAE. Data in AED. Live dataset: `data/klaim/UAE_healthcare/`
- **SILQ** — POS lending, KSA. Data in SAR. Live dataset: `data/SILQ/KSA/` (4 tapes: Nov 2025, Jan 2026, Feb 2026, Mar 2026). Three product types: BNPL, RBF, RCL (Revolving Credit Line). Has dedicated analysis module (`core/analysis_silq.py`), validation (`core/validation_silq.py`), dynamic chart endpoint, and tests.
- **Ejari** — Rent Now Pay Later (RNPL), KSA. Data in USD. **Read-only summary** — no raw loan tape, only a pre-computed ODS workbook with 13 sheets of analysis. Rendered as a dedicated dashboard (`EjariDashboard.jsx`) without live computation. Parser: `core/analysis_ejari.py`. Config: `analysis_type: "ejari_summary"`. Live dataset: `data/Ejari/RNPL/`
- **Tamara** — Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL + BNPL+), KSA & UAE. Saudi Arabia's first fintech unicorn ($1B valuation, 20M+ users, 87K+ merchants). **Data room ingestion** — ~100 source files (vintage cohort matrices, Deloitte FDD, HSBC investor reports, financial models) parsed by `scripts/prepare_tamara_data.py` into structured JSON snapshots. Two products: KSA (SAR, 14 tabs) and UAE (AED, 10 tabs). Dashboard: `TamaraDashboard.jsx`. Parser: `core/analysis_tamara.py`. Config: `analysis_type: "tamara_summary"`. Securitisation: KSA $2.375B (Goldman, Citi, Apollo), UAE $131M (Goldman). Live dataset: `data/Tamara/{KSA,UAE}/`
- **Aajil** — SME raw materials trade credit, KSA. Data in SAR. **Live tape analytics** — multi-sheet xlsx (1,245 deals, 7 sheets: Deals, Payments, DPD Cohorts, Collections). 227 customers, SAR 381M GMV (Principal Amount), SAR 80M outstanding, 87.3% collection rate, 1.5% write-off (19 deals, all Bullet). 3 customer types: Manufacturer, Contractor, Wholesale Trader. Deal types: EMI (51%) and Bullet (49%). Has dedicated analysis module (`core/analysis_aajil.py`, 11 compute functions), validation (`core/validation_aajil.py`), dynamic chart endpoint, and 38 tests. Dashboard: `AajilDashboard.jsx` (13 tabs). Config: `analysis_type: "aajil"`. Live dataset: `data/Aajil/KSA/`. Uses Cascade Debt (app.cascadedebt.com) as external reporting platform. Dataroom: 14 files (investor deck, audited financials, tax returns, budget). NLM notebook with 6 PDFs.
**Asset classes:** Receivables (insurance claims factoring), short-term consumer/POS loans, rent payment financing (RNPL), BNPL consumer instalment lending, and SME trade credit (raw materials).
**Data format:** Single Excel or CSV loan tapes, typically thousands to tens of thousands of rows. Each row is a deal/receivable. Snapshots are taken periodically (e.g. monthly) and named `YYYY-MM-DD_description.csv`. Also supports ODS files (Ejari summary workbook) and JSON files (Tamara data room ingestion).
**Data notes:**
- **Tapes available:** Sep 2025 (25 cols), Dec 2025 (xlsx), Feb 2026 (25 cols), Mar 2026 (60 cols), Apr 2026 (65 cols — latest full snapshot, 8,080 deals)
- Apr 2026 tape (8,080 deals, full portfolio) adds 5 columns: `Expected collection days`, `Collection days so far`, `AccountManager`, `SalesManager`, `Provider`. Enables direct DPD for PAR, temporal Paid vs Due, and direct DSO Operational.
- Sep 2025 tape has `Expected IRR` and `Actual IRR` columns; Dec 2025 and Feb 2026 do not
- Mar 2026 tape restored IRR and added 35 new columns: collection curves (26 cols for expected/actual at 30d intervals up to 390d), `Owner`, `Released from`, `Collected till date by owner`, VAT columns, `FundStatus`
- `Actual IRR for owner` column in Mar 2026 tape has **garbage data** (mean ~2.56e44) — excluded from all analysis
- All tapes have `Discount` column (values range 1%–41%, concentrated at 4–7%)
- `New business` column available for new vs repeat analysis
- Fee columns: `Setup fee`, `Other fee`, `Adjustments`
- Loss tracking: `Provisions`, `Denied by insurance`
- **Column availability drives feature visibility** — features gracefully degrade (hidden, not estimated) on older tapes
-----
## Long-Term Vision (3 Phases)
### Phase 1 — Loan Tape Analysis & Dashboards ✅
- Manual CSV/Excel upload workflow
- AI-powered dashboards per company/product (18 tape analytics tabs)
- Consistency checks across snapshots
- Investment committee-ready commentary + one-click PDF reports
### Phase 2 — Borrowing Base Monitoring ✅
- PostgreSQL 18.3 database with SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM + Alembic migrations
- Integration API (12 endpoints) for portfolio companies to push invoices/payments/bank statements
- Real-time borrowing base waterfall, concentration limits, covenant monitoring
- Portfolio computation engine (`core/portfolio.py`) with DB-optional fallback to tape data
- Frontend: 6 portfolio tabs (Borrowing Base, Concentration Limits, Covenants, Invoices, Payments, Bank Statements)
### Phase 3 — Team & IC Viewing Layer ✅ (partial)
- ✅ Role-based access (admin vs viewer via Cloudflare Access JWT)
- ✅ Cloud deployment (Hetzner VPS, Docker Compose, Cloudflare Access)
- Scheduled report delivery
- Expand roles (analyst, IC, read-only)

-----
## How to Start the App (Every Session)
**One command (recommended):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\SharifEid\credit-platform
.\start.ps1
```
Opens two terminal windows (backend + frontend) and launches the browser automatically.

**Manual start (if needed):**
- Terminal 1 — Backend: `cd credit-platform && venv\Scripts\activate && python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
  > **IMPORTANT:** Run from the project root, NOT from `backend/`. Running from `backend/` causes `backend/operator.py` to shadow Python's built-in `operator` module (circular import crash on Python 3.14+). Use `backend.main:app` (dot notation) from the project root.
- Terminal 2 — Frontend: `cd credit-platform\frontend && npm run dev`
- Then open `http://localhost:5173`

Chat endpoint also accepts `snapshot`, `currency`, `as_of_date` in the POST body (frontend sends them there).
Integration endpoints require `X-API-Key` header (SHA-256 hashed, org-scoped).

| `/framework` | `Framework` | Analysis Framework — analytical philosophy with sticky TOC |
| `/onboard` | `Onboarding` | Self-service company onboarding (4-step form) |

**Sidebar navigation:** 240px persistent sidebar on all company pages. Sections: Company name, Products (if multiple), Executive Summary (gold accent, AI-powered), Tape Analytics (18 links), Portfolio Analytics (6 links), Legal Analysis (8 links), Research Hub (Document Library, Research Chat, IC Memos), Methodology. Active state: gold left border + gold text.

**URL-based tabs:** Active tab driven by `:tab` URL param (not React state). Users can bookmark/share specific views. Slugs: `overview`, `actual-vs-expected`, `deployment`, `collection`, `denial-trend`, `ageing`, `revenue`, `portfolio-tab`, `cohort-analysis`, `returns`, `risk-migration`, `data-integrity`, `loss-waterfall`, `recovery-analysis`, `collections-timing`, `underwriting-drift`, `segment-analysis`, `seasonality`, `cdr-ccr`, `borrowing-base`, `concentration-limits`, `covenants`, `invoices`, `payments`, `bank-statements`.

**Backward compat:** `/company/:co` and `/company/:co/:product` redirect to `tape/overview`.

**State management:** `CompanyContext` provides shared state (company, products, snapshots, config, currency, summary, etc.) consumed by both TapeAnalytics and PortfolioAnalytics.

## Portfolio Analytics Tabs (6) — Live Data ✅
|Tab                  |What It Shows                                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Borrowing Base       |4 KPI cards, waterfall table (gross → eligible → BB), advance rates by region, facility capacity bar, breaching shops|
|Concentration Limits |Summary bar (compliant/breach counts), 2-column grid of limit cards with progress bars, click-to-expand breaching items + adjustment suggestions|
|Covenants            |Covenant cards with threshold bars, calculation breakdowns, compliance badges, historical evaluation dates dropdown|

|Bank Statements      |Cash position KPI cards (balance, collection), historical statement list, PDF download links|

**Data source:** Portfolio Analytics reads from PostgreSQL database when configured (`DATABASE_URL`). Falls back to tape CSV/Excel files if DB not available. The computation engine (`core/portfolio.py`) works with tape-compatible DataFrames regardless of source.
-----
## Legal Analysis Tabs (8) — AI-Powered Document Analysis
|Tab                |What It Shows                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Documents          |PDF upload (drag-drop), document inventory, extraction status badges, re-extract/delete actions|
|Facility Terms     |4 KPI cards (limit, type, maturity, governing law), detail table with all extracted terms|
|Eligibility & Rates|Eligibility criteria table (name, value, section ref, confidence), advance rate schedule cards|
|Covenants & Limits |Two-column comparison: document thresholds vs live portfolio values, breach distance gauge, discrepancy flags|
|Events of Default  |EOD triggers grouped by severity (payment/covenant/cross_default/MAC/operational), cure periods|
|Reporting          |Reporting obligations timeline with frequency badges, normal + default payment waterfall priority|
|Risk Assessment    |AI-generated risk flags (missing provisions, below-market terms), severity badges, recommendations|
|Amendment History  |Document version picker, material changes diff table (old value → new value)|

**Data source:** PDF facility agreements uploaded to `data/{company}/{product}/legal/`. AI extraction via Claude (~$1.25/doc, cached forever). Extracted terms auto-populate `facility_params` via 3-tier priority: document → manual override → hardcoded default.

**Legal Analysis endpoints (under `/companies/{co}/products/{p}/legal/`):**
|Endpoint                     |Method|Description                              |

|`/amendment-diff`            |GET   |Compare two document versions            |
-----
## Data Source Architecture
**Three distinct data pipelines feed the platform:**

| | Tape Analytics | Portfolio Analytics | Legal Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Source** | CSV/Excel files in `data/` | PostgreSQL database (fallback: tape files) | PDF facility agreements in `data/.../legal/` |
| **Ingestion** | Manual upload by analyst | Inbound API from portfolio companies | PDF upload via Legal Analysis tab |
| **Refresh** | Point-in-time snapshots (monthly) | Real-time (as companies push data) | On document upload or amendment |
| **Purpose** | Retrospective analysis, IC reporting | Live monitoring, borrowing base, covenants | Contractual truth, compliance comparison |
| **Backend module** | `core/analysis.py` + `core/loader.py` | `core/portfolio.py` + `core/db_loader.py` | `core/legal_extractor.py` + `core/legal_compliance.py` |

**DB-optional mode:** If `DATABASE_URL` is not set in `.env`, portfolio endpoints automatically fall back to computing from the latest tape CSV/Excel file. This allows the platform to run without PostgreSQL for tape-only analysis.

**Tape-compatible bridge:** `core/db_loader.py` maps database rows (Invoice + Payment records) to DataFrames with identical column names as CSV tapes. This means `core/portfolio.py` and `core/analysis.py` work identically regardless of data source — zero code changes needed.

**Integration API authentication:** Portfolio companies authenticate via `X-API-Key` header. Keys are generated with `scripts/create_api_key.py`, SHA-256 hashed, and stored in the `organizations` table. Each API key is scoped to one organization — queries automatically filter to that org's data.

**Database schema (7 tables):**
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Platform users with email, name, role (admin/viewer), active status |
| `organizations` | Portfolio companies (Klaim, SILQ) with API key hash |
| `products` | Products per org with analysis_type, currency, facility_limit |
| `invoices` | Receivables pool (amount_due, status, customer, extra_data JSONB) |
| `payments` | Payment activity (ADVANCE/PARTIAL/FINAL types) |
| `bank_statements` | Cash position tracking with optional PDF file storage |
| `facility_configs` | Per-facility lending terms in JSONB (advance_rates, concentration_limits, covenants) |

-----
## Research Hub & Memo Engine
The platform includes an AI-powered research and memo generation system built on three layers:

**Data Room Engine** (`core/dataroom/`):
- Ingests any directory of files (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, DOCX, ODS)
- Chunks documents for search, builds TF-IDF index
- Classifies documents by type (16 categories)
- Snapshots platform analytics as searchable research sources
- Registry: `data/{co}/{prod}/dataroom/registry.json`

**Research Intelligence** (`core/research/`):
- Claude RAG query engine with source citations
- NotebookLM bridge (`notebooklm-py` v0.3.4) — first-class second-opinion engine via Python API or CLI fallback
- Dual-engine synthesis: merges best insights from both engines, preserves citation origins
- Notebook ID + synced source persistence via JSON sidecars (`data/{co}/{prod}/dataroom/notebooklm_state.json`)
- Auto-sync: data room ingest triggers NLM source upload
- Auth: `notebooklm login` (local) or `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` env var (headless/server)
- Rules-based insight extraction at ingest time (metrics, covenants, dates, risk flags)

**IC Memo Engine** (`core/memo/`):
- 4 templates: Credit Memo (12 sections), Due Diligence (9), Monthly Monitoring (6), Quarterly Review (5)
- Analytics Bridge: injects live tape/portfolio metrics into memo sections
- AI section generation with prior section coherence + mind context
- Versioning: draft → review → final (immutable versions)
- PDF export in dark theme matching existing research reports

-----
## Living Mind — Institutional Memory
Two-tier knowledge system that makes every AI output smarter over time.

**Master Mind** (`data/_master_mind/`):
- Fund-level knowledge: analytical preferences, IC norms, cross-company patterns, writing style
- Seeded from ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md principles and existing CLAUDE.md lessons
- Feeds into ALL AI prompts as Layer 2 (between Framework and Methodology)

**Company Mind** (`data/{co}/{prod}/mind/`):
- Per-company: corrections, memo edits, research findings, IC feedback, data quality notes
- Auto-populated: legal findings, data quality discoveries, analyst corrections
- Feeds into AI prompts as Layer 4 (most specific context)

**4-Layer Prompt Context:**
1. Analysis Framework (codified rules) — always included
2. Master Mind (fund-level lessons) — filtered by task type
3. Company Methodology (codified company rules) — key formulas and caveats
4. Company Mind (position-level notes) — most recent and relevant

**Knowledge Lifecycle:** Company Mind → Master Mind promotion (cross-company pattern) → Framework codification (permanent rule)

-----
## Currency System
Supported: `AED (0.2723)`, `USD (1.0)`, `EUR (1.08)`, `GBP (1.27)`, `SAR (0.2667)`, `KWD (3.26)`.
Each product has a `config.json` with its reported currency. Frontend shows toggle between reported currency and USD. Backend applies multiplier via `apply_multiplier()` in `core/analysis.py`.
> FX rates fetched live from exchangerate-api.com with hardcoded fallback. Backend endpoint: `GET /fx-rates`.
-----
## Dashboard Customization Philosophy
Each company/product has its own configured dashboard. The platform shares a common shell but specific views, metrics, and AI prompts are driven by asset class and available columns. Onboarding a new company requires designing the right views for that asset class.
**Current implementation:** Klaim (healthcare receivables), SILQ (POS lending), and Ejari (RNPL read-only summary) all onboarded. SILQ has a dedicated analysis module (`core/analysis_silq.py`) and custom dashboard tabs configured via `config.json`. Ejari uses `analysis_type: "ejari_summary"` to render a dedicated read-only dashboard (`EjariDashboard.jsx`) that parses an ODS workbook instead of running live computations. The `analysisType` field in config determines which chart components render.

### Methodology Onboarding Checklist
When onboarding a new company, follow these steps to build its methodology page. Full guide in `core/ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md` Section 7.
1. **Define `analysis_type`** in `config.json` — reuse existing type if same asset class, or create new one
2. **Build methodology sections covering all 5 hierarchy levels:**
   - L1 Size & Composition — what constitutes "a deal", volume metrics, product types
   - L2 Cash Conversion — collection rate formula, DSO variant, timing distribution
   - L3 Credit Quality — distress signal (DPD vs denial vs default), PAR method, health thresholds
   - L4 Loss Attribution — loss event definition, recovery path, margin structure, EL parameters
   - L5 Forward Signals — at least one leading indicator, covenant thresholds, stress scenarios
3. **Add cross-cutting sections** — Product Types, Cohort Analysis, Data Caveats, Currency, Data Quality
4. **Add conditional branch** in `Methodology.jsx` — new `{TYPE}_SECTIONS` array with `level` tags, new content component
5. **Verify metrics match backend** — every formula in the methodology must correspond to an actual computation in the analysis module
-----
## Key Architectural Decisions
- **`core/analysis.py`** — all pure data computation. No FastAPI, no I/O.
- **`core/config.py`** — per-product `config.json` stores currency and description.
- **Snapshot naming** — files must start with `YYYY-MM-DD_` for date parsing.
- **`filter_by_date()`** — filters deals to `Deal date <= as_of_date`. **Always returns a copy** — never mutates the input DataFrame. **Important:** Only filters deal selection by origination date — does NOT adjust balance columns (collected, denied, outstanding). These always reflect the tape snapshot date. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 15.
- **`_load()` in main.py** — matches snapshots by `filename` or `date` field (fixed Feb 2026).
- **AICommentary caching** — two layers: (1) In-memory via `CompanyContext` state, survives tab switches within a session, clears on snapshot change. (2) Disk cache in `reports/ai_cache/` — persists across sessions and users (see below).
- **AI response disk cache** — All AI endpoints (executive summary, commentary, tab insights) cache responses to `reports/ai_cache/` as JSON files. Cache key: `(endpoint, company, product, snapshot_filename, currency, file_mtime)` — currency included because AI commentary embeds currency-specific amounts; file mtime included to auto-invalidate when a same-name file is replaced. `as_of_date` normalized (None/snapshot_date/future all map to same key). `?refresh=true` query param forces regeneration.
- **AI blocked on backdated views** — `_check_backdated()` returns HTTP 400 on all AI endpoints when `as_of_date < snapshot_date`. Balance metrics would be misleading (inflated collection rates, understated outstanding). Frontend: KpiCard shows `TAPE DATE` badge + dimmed value, BackdatedBanner classifies metrics, AI controls disabled with explanation.
- **API response extraction** — `api.js` extracts: `.commentary` for AI commentary, `.insight` for tab insights, `.answer` for chat responses.
- **Text contrast** — `--text-muted` updated from `#4A5568` to `#8494A7` for readability on dark theme.
- **IRR derivation** — backend calculates IRR for tapes that lack IRR columns (derived from purchase price, collected, deal dates).
- All AI calls use `claude-opus-4-6`.
- **`core/migration.py`** — multi-snapshot roll-rate analysis. Requires ≥2 snapshots. Matches deals by ID column across tapes.
- **`core/validation.py`** — single-tape integrity checks (dupes, date sanity, negatives, nulls, logical consistency).
- **Risk migration endpoint** — auto-selects the two most recent snapshots for comparison. Also bundles stress test + EL model results.
- **Data Integrity tab** — two-step workflow: Run Checks (fast, no API cost) → Generate AI Report (Claude API call). Results, reports, and notes cached as JSON files in `reports/{company}_{product}/`. Auto-loads cached results on tab load. Notes saved with 500ms debounce.
- **Data Chat history** — frontend sends `{role: 'ai', text: '...'}`, backend maps to Anthropic format `{role: 'assistant', content: '...'}`. Reads both `text` and `content` fields for compatibility.
- **Data Chat enriched context** — system prompt includes 7+ pre-computed data sections beyond basic KPIs: group performance (top 8 providers with collection/denial/DSO), active portfolio health (ageing buckets), DSO metrics, returns & margins, discount band performance, new vs repeat business, HHI concentration, plus (when available) IRR summary, collection speed by vintage, and owner/SPV allocation. Fallback instruction directs analysts to the full tape or deal team for deal-level questions.
- **Graceful degradation pattern** — new features that depend on Mar 2026 columns (curves, owner, IRR) check `if 'column' in df.columns` and return `{'available': False}` when missing. Frontend checks `.available` and hides sections entirely — no estimates, no placeholders.
- **DSO fix (Mar 2026)** — old method used `today - Deal date` (just deal age). New curve-based method uses `_estimate_dso_from_curves()` to find when 90% of collected amount arrived, interpolating between 30-day intervals. Returns `available: False` on tapes without curve columns.
- **Collection curves** — `compute_collection_curves()` aggregates expected/actual at 30-day intervals. Backend endpoint retained but **removed from dashboard** — aggregate view blends vintages at different life stages, making it misleading for IC audiences. Per-vintage collection speed is better served by the Cohort table (90d/180d/360d columns).
- **Owner/SPV breakdown** — `compute_owner_breakdown()` groups by `Owner` column, uses `Collected till date by owner` when available (450 deals differ from standard `Collected till date`).
- **`Actual IRR for owner`** — **excluded** from all analysis. Column has garbage data (mean ~2.56e44, likely parsing errors in source data).
- **Outstanding amount pattern** — Ageing and Portfolio health charts use `outstanding = PV - Collected - Denied` (clipped at 0) instead of face value. Shows actual risk exposure. Health `percentage` based on outstanding share.
- **Completed-only margins** — All margin calculations in Returns use completed deals only to avoid penalising vintages still collecting. `realised_margin` = `completed_margin`. Discount band, new vs repeat, and monthly margins also filtered to completed.
- **Expected collection rate** — Collection velocity endpoint returns `expected_rate = Expected till date / Purchase value` per month when column available (`has_forecast` flag). Frontend renders as blue dashed line alongside actual rate bars.
- **Sidebar navigation architecture** — Company pages use a persistent 240px sidebar (`Sidebar.jsx`) within `CompanyLayout`. On mobile, sidebar becomes a slide-in drawer (fixed position, `translateX` animation) with dark backdrop overlay, coordinated via `MobileMenuContext`. Hamburger button in Navbar toggles the drawer. Auto-closes on route change, locks body scroll when open. Tabs are `<Link>` elements (not buttons). Active state: gold left border + text.
- **Mobile responsiveness architecture** — All styling uses inline `style={{}}` objects (no Tailwind classes). Responsive behavior uses a `useBreakpoint()` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useBreakpoint.js`) returning `{ isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop }` via `matchMedia` listeners. For grid columns, CSS `auto-fill`/`auto-fit` with `minmax()` is preferred over JS breakpoints — intrinsically responsive. Breakpoints: mobile < 768px, tablet 768-1023px, desktop >= 1024px. `--navbar-height` CSS variable responds to viewport. **Important:** Any flex container that switches between sidebar (desktop) and stacked (mobile) layout MUST include `flexDirection: isMobile ? 'column' : 'row'` — the default `row` breaks mobile.
- **URL-based tab navigation** — Active tab stored in URL `:tab` param, not React state. Enables bookmarking/sharing. `TapeAnalytics` reads `useParams().tab`, maps slug to label via `SLUG_TO_LABEL`.
- **CompanyContext** — Central state provider extracted from old `Company.jsx`. Both `TapeAnalytics` and `PortfolioAnalytics` consume via `useCompany()` hook. Prevents re-fetches when switching between tape and portfolio views.
- **CompanyLayout** — Wraps `CompanyProvider` around `Sidebar` + `<Outlet>`. Simple flex layout: sidebar (240px fixed) + main content area (flex: 1).
- **Portfolio Analytics live data** — All 6 portfolio tabs now use real backend endpoints. `_portfolio_load()` in `main.py` auto-selects data source: DB if configured and has data, otherwise falls back to tape files. Returns tape-compatible DataFrame.
- **DB-optional architecture** — `core/database.py` checks for `DATABASE_URL` in env. If missing, all DB-touching code gracefully returns None. Portfolio endpoints fall back to tape data. App runs fine without PostgreSQL.
- **Tape-compatible DataFrame bridge** — `core/db_loader.py` maps Invoice+Payment DB records to DataFrames with identical column names as CSV tapes. `load_klaim_from_db()` and `load_silq_from_db()` handle company-specific mappings. Zero changes needed to analysis functions.
- **Integration API authentication** — `backend/auth.py` validates `X-API-Key` header via SHA-256 hash lookup. `get_current_org()` FastAPI dependency injects the authenticated Organization. All integration queries are org-scoped.
- **Bulk operations** — Integration API supports up to 5,000 invoices/payments per bulk request with per-item error tracking.
- **Tiered concentration limits** — Single-borrower limit scales with facility size per loan docs ($10M→20%, $20M→15%, >$20M→10%). Implemented in `core/portfolio.py` `_conc_threshold()`.
- **Facility config as JSONB** — `FacilityConfig` model stores advance_rates, concentration_limits, covenants as flexible JSON for per-facility customization.
- **Portfolio computation engine** — `core/portfolio.py` contains pure functions: `compute_borrowing_base()` (waterfall + eligibility), `compute_concentration_limits()` (4 limits with breach drill-down), `compute_covenants()` (5-6 per asset class), `compute_portfolio_flow()` (cash waterfall). Supports both Klaim and SILQ asset classes.
- **PDF report generation** — `generate_report.py` uses Playwright headless Chrome to screenshot all 11 tape tabs (excluding Data Integrity) via sidebar link navigation. Navigates to `/company/:co/:product/tape/:slug` URLs. ReportLab composes a professional PDF (dark cover page with LAITH branding, TOC, full-width tab screenshots). Backend `POST /generate-report` endpoint runs the script as a subprocess, streams the PDF via `FileResponse`, and auto-deletes the temp file via `BackgroundTask`. Frontend receives blob, creates `blob://` URL, opens in new tab. Nothing saved to disk — user saves manually from Chrome's PDF viewer. Playwright falls back to `channel="chrome"` (local Chrome) if managed Chromium is unavailable.
- **SILQ multi-sheet Excel loader** — `core/loader.py` reads all data sheets from the Excel workbook and concatenates them. Three product types: BNPL, RBF, RCL. Row 1 is header (row 0 has formulas). `Loan_Type` column in RCL sheet mapped to `Product`.
- **As-of date default** — `date-range` endpoint returns `snapshot_date` extracted from filename. Frontend uses `max(data_max_date, snapshot_date)` as calendar upper bound and default.
- **Framer Motion integration** — Uses `motion.div` wrappers with `initial`/`animate`/`exit` props. `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` for tab transitions and chart loading states. KPI stagger via `index * 0.04s` delay. All animations use `transform`/`opacity` for GPU acceleration.
- **PDF report wait strategy** — 3-phase approach per tab: 4s initial mount wait → poll for "Loading..." spinners to disappear (max 20s, double-confirm) → 2s animation settle. ~6.5s per tab, ~70s total.
- **Analysis Framework** — `core/ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md` defines a 5-level analytical hierarchy (Size → Cash Conversion → Credit Quality → Loss Attribution → Forward Signals). All new tabs and metrics are mapped to this hierarchy. Framework served via `GET /framework` endpoint, rendered as full-page markdown with sticky TOC.
- **PAR computation (dual perspective)** — 3-method approach: (1) Primary uses `Expected till date` shortfall-based estimated DPD, (2) Option C builds empirical benchmarks from 50+ completed deals, (3) Fallback returns `available: False`. **Dual denominator:** Active PAR (behind-schedule outstanding / active outstanding — monitoring view, was showing 46% PAR30) and Lifetime PAR (behind-schedule outstanding / total originated — IC view, shows 3.6% PAR30). Tape Analytics shows Lifetime as headline with Active as context subtitle. The issue: active outstanding is only ~8% of total originated, which dramatically inflated the active ratio. Portfolio Analytics uses eligible outstanding for covenants. "Derived from historical patterns" badge shown when Option C used.
- **DTFC (Days to First Cash)** — leading indicator that deteriorates before collection rate does. Curve-based method (precise) uses collection curve columns; estimated method (fallback) approximates from deal dates and collected amounts. Shows Median and P90 on Overview.
- **DSO dual perspectives** — DSO Capital (days from funding to collection) measures capital efficiency. DSO Operational (days from expected due date to collection) measures payer behavior. Both use curve-based and estimated methods.
- **Cohort loss waterfall** — "default" for Klaim = denial > 50% of purchase value (since there are no contractual due dates). Per-vintage waterfall: Originated → Gross Default → Recovery → Net Loss. Integrates vintage loss curves and loss categorization.
- **Separation Principle** — `separate_portfolio()` splits into clean (active + normal completed) vs loss (denial > 50% PV). Clean portfolio used for performance metrics; loss portfolio isolated for attribution analysis. Prevents loss deals from distorting healthy portfolio metrics.
- **Loss categorization heuristics** — `compute_loss_categorization()` applies rules-based classification: provider_issue (high denial from specific groups), coding_error (partial denials suggesting claim issues), credit/underwriting (remaining). Not ML — transparent heuristics for analyst interpretation.
- **Collections timing** — `compute_collections_timing()` uses collection curve columns (Expected/Actual at 30d intervals) to build timing bucket distributions. Returns both per-vintage and portfolio-level views. Requires Mar 2026+ tape with curve columns.
- **Segment analysis multi-dimensional cuts** — `compute_segment_analysis()` supports 4 dimensions: product type, provider_size (bucketed by PV volume), deal_size (quartile-based), new_repeat. Each dimension returns per-segment metrics with deal count, volume, collection/denial rates, margins.
- **HHI time series** — `compute_hhi_for_snapshot()` computes HHI for a single snapshot. Endpoint loads ALL snapshots to build time series, detects trend (increasing/decreasing/stable) and issues warnings when concentration is rising.
- **Underwriting drift** — `compute_underwriting_drift()` compares per-vintage metrics (avg deal size, discount, collection rate) against historical norms (rolling mean of prior vintages). Flags vintages where metrics deviate beyond 1 standard deviation.
- **Seasonality** — `compute_seasonality()` groups deployment by calendar month across years for YoY comparison. Computes seasonal index (month average / overall average) to identify seasonal patterns in origination.
- **Methodology log** — `compute_methodology_log()` documents all data corrections, column availability checks, and data quality decisions applied during analysis. Provides audit trail for IC-level transparency.
- **Summary field name convention** — The frontend expects canonical field names from `/summary`: `total_purchase_value`, `total_deals`, `collection_rate`, etc. Company-specific analysis functions may use domain terms (e.g. SILQ's `total_disbursed`). The summary must return BOTH the domain-specific name AND the canonical alias (e.g. `'total_purchase_value': _safe(total_disbursed)`). This ensures landing page cards and aggregate stats work uniformly across all companies. **Label override pattern:** Tamara's `total_purchase_value` is outstanding AR (not originated), so it returns `face_value_label: "Outstanding AR"` and `deals_label: "Reports"`. The frontend reads these optional fields and overrides the default card labels. Companies that don't return these fields get the defaults ("Face Value", "Deals"). Tamara is excluded from the aggregate "Face Value Analyzed" banner to avoid mixing outstanding with originated.
- **Living Methodology architecture** — Methodology page content is stored as structured Python dicts in companion files (`core/methodology_klaim.py`, `core/methodology_silq.py`) rather than hardcoded JSX. Backend serves via `GET /methodology/{analysis_type}`. Frontend renders dynamically using existing Metric/Table/Note/Section components. Companion files (not inline decorators) chosen because methodology metadata is large (multi-line strings, nested structures) — keeping `analysis.py` as pure computation. Ejari uses static JSON file at `data/Ejari/RNPL/methodology.json`. New companies: create `methodology_{type}.py`, register at startup → page works automatically.
- **Ejari read-only summary pattern** — When `analysis_type` is `"ejari_summary"`, the platform bypasses all tape loading and computation. TapeAnalytics renders `EjariDashboard.jsx` which reads the URL `:tab` param and renders only the matching section. The `parse_ejari_workbook()` function in `core/analysis_ejari.py` reads the ODS file once (cached per session), extracting 12 structured sections. Config uses `hide_portfolio_tabs: true` to suppress Portfolio Analytics in sidebar, and sidebar header shows "Analysis" instead of "Tape Analytics". EjariDashboard uses shared `KpiCard` and `ChartPanel` components (same as Klaim/SILQ) for visual consistency. Only `DataTable` remains Ejari-specific (renders ODS tabular data). This pattern can be reused for any future company that provides pre-computed analysis instead of raw tapes.
- **Tamara data room ingestion pattern** — When `analysis_type` is `"tamara_summary"`, the platform loads a pre-processed JSON snapshot instead of a tape or ODS workbook. The JSON is produced by `scripts/prepare_tamara_data.py` which reads ~100 source files from the data room (vintage cohort Excel matrices, Deloitte FDD loan portfolio, HSBC investor report PDFs via pdfplumber, financial models, portfolio demographics). The ETL runs once offline; the runtime parser (`core/analysis_tamara.py`) loads JSON, enriches with presentation fields (covenant status colors, heatmap color scales, derived KPIs), and serves via a single cached endpoint. This is the **third data ingestion pattern** alongside raw tapes and pre-computed summaries. `loader.py` extended to recognize `.json` files in `get_snapshots()`.
- **Credit Research Report platform capability** — `core/research_report.py` generates comprehensive dark-themed PDF credit research reports for ANY company, not just Tamara. Uses ReportLab Platypus with Laith branding (navy background, gold headers, styled tables). Backend endpoint `POST /research-report` dispatches to company-specific builders based on `analysis_type`. Tamara builder produces 8 sections (exec summary, company overview, portfolio analytics, vintage performance, covenants, facility structure, DPD analysis, data sources). Accepts optional `ai_narrative` parameter for Claude-powered narrative sections. Generic fallback builder handles companies without a dedicated builder.
- **ODS and JSON file support** — `core/loader.py` `get_snapshots()` now accepts `.ods` and `.json` files alongside `.csv` and `.xlsx`. ODS requires `odfpy` package. **Important:** `config.json` and `methodology.json` are excluded via `_EXCLUDE` set to prevent non-data files from appearing as snapshots.
- **Overview page standardization** — All company overviews follow a consistent section structure guided by the L1-L5 analytical hierarchy: (1) Main KPIs (L1/L2, 5-col grid, bespoke per company), (2) "Credit Quality" section (L3, PAR 30+/60+/90+ as individual cards), (3) "Leading Indicators" section (L5, DTFC etc when available). PAR cards always use `{ccy} {amount}K at risk` subtitle format. Fixed 5-column grids prevent async reflow. Bespoke KPIs encouraged within each section.
- **Executive Summary always visible** — Sidebar shows Executive Summary for all companies including Ejari. Decoupled from `hide_portfolio_tabs` flag which only controls Portfolio Analytics tabs.
- **Executive Summary dual-output architecture** — Single AI call returns JSON object with `narrative` (sections array + summary_table + bottom_line) and `findings` (array, same as before). Company-specific section guidance injected into prompt. Response parsing handles both old format (array) and new format (object) for backward compat. `max_tokens=8000` for the combined output. Generation takes ~50-60s vs ~10s previously.
- **Legal Analysis — third analytical pillar** — AI-powered facility agreement analysis alongside Tape Analytics and Portfolio Analytics. PDF upload → 5-pass Claude extraction → structured JSON (eligibility, advance rates, covenants, concentration limits, EOD, reporting, waterfall) → cached to `data/{co}/{prod}/legal/`. 8 frontend tabs in sidebar between Portfolio Analytics and Methodology. Hidden when `hide_portfolio_tabs: true` (same as Portfolio — legal analysis requires portfolio context).
- **Legal extraction engine** — `core/legal_extractor.py` runs 5 passes: (1) definitions & structure, (2) facility + eligibility + advance rates, (3) covenants + concentration limits, (4) EOD + reporting + waterfall, (5) AI risk assessment. Each pass prepends the definitions glossary and targets specific sections. ~$1.25/document, cached forever. Sonnet for passes 1-4, Opus for risk assessment.
- **3-tier facility params priority** — `_load_facility_params()` in `main.py` merges: (1) document-extracted values from `legal/` (baseline), (2) manual overrides from `facility_params.json` (precedence), (3) hardcoded defaults in compute functions (fallback). `_sources` dict tracks provenance per field. FacilityParamsPanel shows `Source: Document` vs `Source: Manual` badges.
- **Legal compliance comparison** — `core/legal_compliance.py` `build_compliance_comparison()` matches extracted covenant thresholds against live portfolio values from `compute_klaim_covenants()`. Returns breach distance (% headroom), discrepancy flags (document vs hardcoded default), and overall compliance summary. Fed into executive summary AI context.
- **PDF parsing pipeline** — `core/legal_parser.py` uses PyMuPDF (`pymupdf4llm`) for markdown conversion preserving headers/structure, plus `pdfplumber` for table extraction (advance rate schedules, concentration tier tables). Semantic chunking by article/section headers (legal docs are well-structured). Definitions section isolated first as context for all subsequent extraction passes.
- **Legal extraction schema** — `core/LEGAL_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA.md` defines extraction taxonomy (7 sections), Pydantic models in `core/legal_schemas.py`, confidence grading (HIGH >= 0.85, MED >= 0.70, LOW < 0.70), and facility_params mapping table (12 fields). Companion to ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 16.
- **Living Mind 4-layer architecture** — Framework (codified rules) → Master Mind (fund lessons) → Methodology (company rules) → Company Mind (position notes). Every AI prompt sees all 4 layers. Knowledge flows upward: fast corrections → consolidation → codification.
- **Dual-engine research** — Claude RAG (primary) + NotebookLM (second opinion, first-class). Both run on every query when available, synthesis merges best insights with citation origin tracking. `notebooklm-py` v0.3.4 via Python API (preferred) or CLI fallback. Auth: `notebooklm login` (browser OAuth, saves to `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json`) or `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` env var (headless). Notebook IDs + synced sources persisted to `data/{co}/{prod}/dataroom/notebooklm_state.json`. Data room ingest auto-syncs to NLM. Chat persona configured for credit analysis. Frontend shows engine badges (blue=Claude, teal=NLM, gold=merged), NLM status indicator, and synthesis notes. Graceful fallback to Claude-only when NLM unavailable. **Important:** `ClaudeQueryEngine._get_client()` uses `load_dotenv(override=True)` to ensure `.env` values override empty env vars inherited from parent shell — without `override`, an empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the shell silently disables Claude synthesis.
- **Analytics-as-source** — Platform-computed analytics (tape summaries, PAR, DSO) snapshotted into the data room as searchable documents. Memos can cite "Tape Analytics — PAR Analysis, Mar 2026" alongside "HSBC Investor Report, Jan 2026".
- **Memo feedback loop** — Analyst edits to AI-generated memo sections are recorded in Company Mind. Future memos benefit from accumulated style preferences and corrections.
- **Legal extraction caching** — Extract once per PDF, cache forever. 5-pass Claude pipeline (~$1.25/doc). 3-tier merge: document > manual > hardcoded.
- **Multi-document extraction merge** — `load_latest_extraction()` merges all `*_extracted.json` files in the legal directory. Lists (covenants, EODs, reporting) concatenated and deduped by name. Dicts (facility_terms) merged with primary credit_agreement winning on conflict. Tracks `source_documents` array for provenance.
- **Consecutive breach EoD tracking** — `annotate_covenant_eod()` in `core/portfolio.py` (pure function) + `covenant_history.json` (I/O in `main.py`). Per MMA 18.3: `single_breach_not_eod` (PAR30), `single_breach_is_eod` (PAR60, Parent Cash), `two_consecutive_breaches` (Collection Ratio, Paid vs Due). History persists max 24 periods, dedupes by date.
- **Payment schedule as static data** — Stored in `data/{co}/{prod}/legal/payment_schedule.json` (not extracted by AI). Backend reporting endpoint loads and serves it alongside extracted reporting requirements. Frontend renders with PAID/NEXT badges relative to today's date.
- **Registry format** — Both DataRoomEngine and AnalyticsSnapshotEngine use dict[str, dict] registry format (keyed by doc_id). Auto-migrates old list format on read.
- **Intelligence System — Knowledge Graph architecture** — KnowledgeNode extends MindEntry via composition (not inheritance). New fields stored in `metadata["_graph"]` subkey for backward-compatible JSONL storage. Lazy upgrade on read via `upgrade_entry()` — no batch migration needed. RelationIndex is a separate JSON file (`relations.json`) per scope — bidirectional adjacency list. Event bus is synchronous, in-process, with `disable()` for test isolation.
- **Intelligence System — Incremental compilation** — Entity extraction (regex-based, 7 types) feeds into a KnowledgeCompiler that creates/supersedes/reinforces/contradicts existing nodes. One document → 10-15 knowledge updates. Compilation reports logged to `compilation_log.jsonl`. Entities stored in dedicated `entities.jsonl` per company.
- **Intelligence System — Closed-loop learning** — Every analyst correction auto-classified (tone_shift, threshold_override, data_caveat, etc.) and auto-generates learning rules as KnowledgeNodes (node_type="rule"). Patterns extracted when same correction type appears 3+ times → codification candidates. Rules have `last_triggered` and `trigger_count` metadata for decay tracking.
- **Intelligence System — Thesis tracker** — Per-company investment thesis with measurable pillars linked to computed metrics (e.g., "collection_rate" > 0.85). Auto-drift detection on tape ingestion: holding → weakening (within 10% of threshold) → broken (breached). Conviction score (0-100) aggregated from pillar scores. Thesis injected as Layer 5 in AI prompts.
- **Intelligence System — 5-layer AI context** — Framework (L1) → Master Mind (L2) → Methodology (L3) → Company Mind (L4) → Thesis (L5, new). Layer 5 includes active pillars with statuses and drift alerts, making every AI output thesis-aware.
- **Cloudflare Access JWT auth** — Platform authentication delegated to Cloudflare Access (team: `amwalcp`). Backend reads `CF_Authorization` cookie or `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header, verifies RS256 JWT against public keys from `amwalcp.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/certs` (cached 1hr). User table maps email → role (admin/viewer). Auto-provisions users on first login. `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var bootstraps first admin. Auth middleware skips `/auth/*`, `/api/integration/*`, OPTIONS. When `CF_TEAM` not set (local dev), middleware passes all requests through — zero friction for development. Existing X-API-Key integration auth completely untouched.
- **docker-compose env var precedence** — `environment` section overrides `env_file` values. Auth vars (`CF_TEAM`, `CF_APP_AUD`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`) must only be in `.env.production` via `env_file`, NOT in the `environment` section (which reads from host shell and gets empty strings).
- **Operator Command Center** — `/operator/status` reads from existing files only (config.json, registry.json, mind/*.jsonl, legal/*_extracted.json, reports/ai_cache/). No new data infrastructure. Gap detection uses heuristic rules. Personal follow-ups stored in `tasks/operator_todo.json` (separate from Claude's `tasks/todo.md`). Frontend at `/operator` with 5 tabs: Health Matrix, Commands, Follow-ups, Activity Log, Mind Review. `/ops` slash command provides terminal briefing.
- **Activity logging** — `core/activity_log.py` appends to `reports/activity_log.jsonl`. Imported by 14 endpoints (AI, reports, legal, data room, memos, mind, alerts). Log_activity() calls placed before return statements. Only logs fresh operations (not cache hits for AI endpoints).
- **Weekend Deep Work protocol** — `WEEKEND_DEEP_WORK.md` defines 7 analytical modes for long Claude Code sessions. State-save via `reports/deep-work/progress.json`. Two-pass file analysis (core engines before UI). Self-audit validation pass. Tiered frequency schedule (weekly Red Team → quarterly Full Combo).

## What's Working
- ✅ **Authentication + RBAC (Cloudflare Access JWT + app-side roles):**
  - Cloudflare Access handles login (email OTP, allowlists, geo-restrictions) — branded login page with dark navy background + lion logo
  - Backend: `backend/cf_auth.py` — reads `CF_Authorization` cookie / `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header, verifies RS256 JWT against Cloudflare public keys, caches keys (1hr TTL)
  - Auto-provisioning: first login creates User record. `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var gets admin role, all others get viewer
  - Auth middleware: `CloudflareAuthMiddleware` — skips `/auth/*`, `/api/integration/*`, OPTIONS. Dev mode (no `CF_TEAM`) passes all requests through
  - Auth routes: `backend/auth_routes.py` — `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout-url`, `/auth/users` CRUD (admin-only)
  - User model: `core/models.py` `User` table (email, name, role, is_active, timestamps). Migration `b2f3a8c91d45`
  - Frontend: `AuthContext.jsx` (calls `/auth/me` on mount), `ProtectedRoute.jsx` (route guard), `UserMenu` dropdown in Navbar (initials avatar, email, role badge, "Manage Users" for admin, "Log out")
  - User Management: `/admin/users` page — invite users, edit roles, deactivate/reactivate (admin-only)
  - Env vars: `CF_TEAM`, `CF_APP_AUD`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env.production`
  - Existing X-API-Key integration auth completely untouched
- ✅ **Operator Command Center (`/operator` page + `/ops` slash command):**
  - Backend: `backend/operator.py` — `GET /operator/status` (aggregate health, gaps, commands), todo CRUD, mind browse/promote, Slack digest
  - Activity logging: `core/activity_log.py` — centralized JSONL logger wired into 14 endpoints (AI, reports, legal, data room, memos, mind, alerts)
  - Frontend: `OperatorCenter.jsx` — 5-tab dashboard (Health Matrix, Commands, Follow-ups, Activity Log, Mind Review)
  - Health Matrix: per-company cards with tape freshness badges (green/amber/red), legal/dataroom/mind stats, auto-detected gaps
  - Command menu: 11 framework + 3 session + 7 deep work modes in categorized grid
  - Follow-ups: persistent todo list (`tasks/operator_todo.json`) with priority, category, company tags — separate from Claude's `tasks/todo.md`
  - Mind Review: browse all mind entries (master + company), filter by source, promote company entries to master mind
  - Navigation: `/operator` route, "Ops" link in Navbar, Operator Card in Home Resources
  - `/ops` slash command: terminal operator briefing at session start
- ✅ **Weekend Deep Work protocol (`WEEKEND_DEEP_WORK.md`):**
  - 7 modes: Codebase Health Audit, Test Generation Sprint, Architecture Review, Documentation Sprint, Prompt Optimisation, Red Team Review, Regression Validation
  - State-save progress manifest (`reports/deep-work/progress.json`) for session resumption
  - Two-pass file analysis strategy (core engines before UI)
  - Self-audit validation pass cross-referencing CLAUDE.md and ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md
  - Financial business logic stress tests (covenant leakage, waterfall errors, separation principle)
  - Tiered frequency: weekly (Red Team) → bi-weekly (Health + Tests) → monthly (Architecture + Regression) → quarterly (Full Combo)
- ✅ **Legal Analysis (third pillar):**
  - PDF upload + 5-pass AI extraction engine (`core/legal_extractor.py`) — ~$1.25/doc, cached forever
  - Pydantic extraction schemas (`core/legal_schemas.py`) — Tier 1 (facility, eligibility, advance rates, covenants, concentration), Tier 2 (EOD, reporting, waterfall), Tier 3 (risk flags)
  - 3-tier facility params priority: document → manual → hardcoded default. `_load_facility_params()` auto-merges
  - Compliance comparison engine (`core/legal_compliance.py`) — doc terms vs live portfolio metrics side-by-side
  - 12 backend endpoints (`backend/legal.py`) — upload, documents, facility-terms, eligibility, covenants-extracted, events-of-default, reporting, risk-flags, compliance-comparison, amendment-diff
  - Frontend: `LegalAnalytics.jsx` + 8 tab components (DocumentUpload, FacilityTerms, EligibilityView, CovenantComparison, EventsOfDefault, ReportingCalendar, RiskAssessment, AmendmentHistory)
  - Sidebar: Legal Analysis section between Portfolio Analytics and Methodology (hidden when `hide_portfolio_tabs: true`)
  - Executive summary integration: legal compliance context fed into `_build_klaim_full_context()`
  - Framework: `LEGAL_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA.md` — extraction taxonomy, confidence grading, param mapping
  - 22 tests (schemas, mapping, compliance comparison, parser utils) — all passing
  - Parameterized `ineligibility_age_days` and `cash_ratio_limit` in `core/portfolio.py` (was hardcoded 365 and 3.0)
  - **Klaim facility documents reviewed:** 4 PDFs (MMA 130pp, MRPA 60pp, Qard 15pp, Fee Letter 3pp) with human-reviewed extraction JSONs at 96% confidence, $0 AI cost
  - **Multi-document extraction merge:** `load_latest_extraction()` merges all documents — lists concatenated (deduped by name), dicts merged (primary credit_agreement wins)
  - **Account Debtor validation:** CRITICAL DATA GAP — tape has no payer column; 10% non-eligible debtor limit unenforceable from tape data. Saved to `legal/debtor_validation.json`
  - **Payment schedule:** 17-payment schedule ($6M, 13% p.a., ACT/360) stored in `legal/payment_schedule.json`, served via reporting endpoint, rendered in ReportingCalendar.jsx
  - **Consecutive breach history:** `annotate_covenant_eod()` + `covenant_history.json` persistence per MMA 18.3 — `first_breach`, `breach_no_eod`, `eod_triggered` statuses with styled frontend badges
  - **Path fix:** `get_legal_dir()` now uses absolute path (was relative, broke when backend ran from subdirectory)
- ✅ **Creative UI redesign (branch: claude/creative-landing-page-research-5hdf6):**
  - Landing page: Islamic geometric SVG background pattern (Girih/8-point star, gold, 14% opacity, 140px tile) — stroke widths tuned for visibility (1.0 lines, 1.6 star, 2.2 dots)
  - Landing page: Syne 800 display font for hero headline + LAITH wordmark; `--font-display` CSS token
  - Landing page: TypewriterText subtitle (character-by-character, blinking cursor, respects prefers-reduced-motion)
  - Landing page: HeroLogo entrance animation (lion scale-pulse on load, gold glow pulse CSS keyframe)
  - Landing page: Two-banner PortfolioStatsHero strip — Banner 1 "Data Analyzed" (gold tint, live from `/aggregate-stats`): Face Value Analyzed, Deals Processed, Data Points (XM+), Snapshots Loaded, Portfolio Companies with ease-out expo count-up; Banner 2 "Live Portfolio" (neutral, all `—` until DB data connected): Active Exposure, PAR 30+, PAR 90+, Covenants in Breach, HHI
  - Landing page: CompanyCard two-row layout — Row 1 Tape Analytics (Face Value | Deals | Since); Row 2 Live Portfolio (Borr. Base | PAR 30+ | Covenants, all `—`). `CardRow`/`CardStat`/`CardDivider` sub-components. 3D hover tilt, animated top border sweep, 80ms stagger.
  - Landing page: LandingCanvas removed (geometric pattern provides ambient texture without JS overhead)
  - Company pages: Tab transitions enhanced — blur(3px→0) + y:12→0 with easeOut cubic, blur fade-out on exit
  - Company pages: Sidebar NavItem — animated left border (Framer Motion scaleY 0→1, origin top) + gold gradient background sweep on active state; micro-indent on hover
  - Company pages: KpiCard sparkline — optional `sparklineData` prop renders 60×18px inline SVG polyline with endpoint dot
  - Company pages: DataChat per-company question sets — `PROMPTS` map keyed by `analysisType` (`silq`, `ejari_summary`, `default`); relevant suggested questions for each asset class
  - Research Chat: per-company suggested questions — `SUGGESTED_QUESTIONS` map keyed by `analysisType` (`klaim`, `silq`, `ejari_summary`, `tamara_summary`, `default`); tailored data room questions per company
  - Typography: Syne (display/hero), Space Grotesk (UI body), JetBrains Mono (data). Single Google Fonts load in index.html. All 55+ IBM Plex Mono / Inter hardcoded references replaced with CSS tokens.
  - Navbar: height 56→80px, lion icon 36→54px, LAITH wordmark 22→33px (Syne 800), "Data Analytics" label 10→15px
  - Landing page section labels: "Portfolio Companies" + "Resources" 9→13px
  - Backend: `/aggregate-stats` endpoint — 5 stats: face value (latest snapshot, no double-count, incl. Ejari total_funded), deals (all snapshots incl. Ejari ODS total_contracts), data points (rows×cols across all snapshots), snapshots, companies. Schema version `"4"` in fingerprint busts cache on field changes. FX-normalised to USD.
  - Backend: `/companies` endpoint extended with `since` field (earliest snapshot date across all products).
  - Backend: `/summary` for ejari_summary now returns real ODS data — `total_contracts` → deals, `total_funded` → face value. ODS values are comma-formatted strings (`'1,348'`) — stripped before int/float conversion.
  - New component: `PortfolioStatsHero.jsx` (two-banner stats strip)
  - New asset: `frontend/public/geometric-pattern.svg` (Islamic 8-point star lattice)
  - New slash command: `.claude/commands/eod.md` — 11-step end-of-session checklist (tests, .env check, cache cleanup, docs, commit, push, sync)
- ✅ **AI response caching (disk-based, cross-user):**
  - Executive summary (~$0.48/call), commentary (~$0.06/call), tab insights (~$0.02/call x 18 tabs) cached to `reports/ai_cache/`
  - Cache key: `(endpoint, company, product, snapshot, currency, file_mtime)` — separate cache per currency, auto-invalidates on file replacement
  - `?refresh=true` query param forces regeneration; frontend shows CACHED badge + Regenerate button
  - `GET /ai-cache-status` endpoint reports what's cached for a given snapshot
- ✅ **Backdated view data integrity:**
  - Backend: AI endpoints blocked (HTTP 400) when `as_of_date < snapshot_date`
  - Frontend: KpiCard `TAPE DATE` badge + dimmed value on balance-dependent metrics
  - BackdatedBanner classifies metrics as ACCURATE (deal count, deployment) vs TAPE DATE (rates, outstanding, margins)
  - AICommentary, TabInsight, ExecutiveSummary disabled with explanation
  - ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 15 documents metric classification and enforcement rules
- ✅ Full backend with all chart and AI endpoints (including returns-analysis)
- ✅ 18-tab React dashboard with dark theme
- ✅ AI commentary (cached in-memory per session + disk cache across users)

- ✅ Currency toggle (local ↔ USD) across all charts and KPIs
- ✅ Snapshot switching — reloads all charts and KPIs correctly
- ✅ As-of Date picker — filters data across all views
- ✅ Loading indicators (gold animated bar + skeleton KPIs)

- ✅ IRR calculation in backend for tapes lacking IRR columns (derived from purchase price, collected, deal dates)
- ✅ DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) — weighted, median, p95 on completed deals
- ✅ HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) — on Group and Product concentration
- ✅ Denial funnel / resolution pipeline (Total → Collected → Pending → Denied → Provisioned)
- ✅ Stress testing — top-1/3/5 provider shock scenarios
- ✅ Expected Loss model (PD × LGD × EAD from completed deal outcomes)
- ✅ Loss development triangle (denial by vintage age)
- ✅ Per-group performance table (collection rate, denial rate, DSO per provider)
- ✅ Roll-rate migration matrix across snapshots (cure rates, transition probabilities)
- ✅ Single-tape data quality validation (dupes, date sanity, negatives, nulls)
- ✅ Risk & Migration tab (11th tab) — institutional-grade risk analytics
- ✅ Enhanced Overview with 12+ KPI cards (DSO, HHI, PAR 30+/60+/90+, DTFC median/P90)

- ✅ Enhanced Actual vs Expected — 6 KPI summary cards (purchase price, discount, expected total, collected/pending/denied with % badges) + Today reference line
- ✅ Enhanced Deployment — dual charts: by business type (new/repeat) + by product type (new endpoint)
- ✅ Enhanced Collection — collection rate with 3M avg + cash collection breakdown by deal age (horizontal bars + donut + avg days outstanding)
- ✅ Enhanced Ageing — monthly stacked bars by health status (Healthy/Watch/Delayed/Poor) over time + cumulative donut, plus existing bucket bars
- ✅ Enhanced Portfolio — portfolio health donut + ageing by purchase date donut (side-by-side) added between concentration and performance sections
- ✅ **March 2026 tape analytics** (all gracefully degrade on older tapes):
  - Collection curves — removed from dashboard (aggregate view was misleading for IC; per-vintage collection speed covered by Cohort table). Backend endpoint retained.
  - IRR analysis — 4 KPIs (avg expected/actual IRR, spread, median), vintage bar chart, distribution histogram
  - Owner/SPV breakdown — concentration donut + performance table (6 owners: SPV1-4, KKTL, Wio)
  - Cohort collection speed — 90d/180d/360d % columns with SpeedHeat color coding
  - DSO fix — curve-based calculation (90% collection point), hidden on tapes without curve data
  - VAT summary in revenue endpoint (vat_assets + vat_fees)
  - Enriched Data Chat context with IRR, collection speed, owner sections
- ✅ March 2026 data tape added: `2026-03-03_uae_healthcare.csv` (7,697 deals, 60 columns)
- ✅ **Metric accuracy fixes** (completed-only margins, outstanding-based health):
  - Ageing tab: switched from face value to outstanding (PV − Collected − Denied) — AED 50.4M actual risk vs misleading AED 198.6M face value
  - Portfolio tab: health + ageing donuts aligned to outstanding metric
  - Returns tab: all margins (portfolio, monthly, discount bands, new vs repeat) now computed on completed deals only — Realised Margin 5.27% (was −4.16%). Added Capital Recovery KPI (95.84%)
  - Collection tab: added Expected Rate line (blue dashed) showing `Expected till date / Purchase value` per vintage — contextualises the rate cliff for recent months
- ✅ **One-click PDF Report** — gold "PDF Report" button in dashboard controls bar:
  - Playwright headless Chrome screenshots all 11 tabs (excl. Data Integrity)
  - ReportLab composes professional PDF: dark cover page (LAITH branding), TOC, tab pages with headers/footers
  - Streaming response — no files saved to disk; PDF opens in new browser tab as blob URL
  - Button states: idle (gold outline), generating (grey + spinner), error (red + retry)
  - ~70s generation time, 13-page ~2MB PDF
- ✅ **Sidebar navigation + URL-based routing** — Company pages use persistent sidebar with Tape Analytics (19 tabs) + Portfolio Analytics (6 tabs) + Methodology. Tabs are URL-driven (`/tape/:slug`, `/portfolio/:slug`), bookmarkable. Old horizontal tab bar replaced.
- ✅ **CompanyContext + CompanyLayout** — Shared state provider (`CompanyContext.jsx`) consumed by all company pages. `CompanyLayout.jsx` renders sidebar + `<Outlet>`. Extracted from old `Company.jsx` (deleted).
- ✅ **Landing page cleanup** — Removed duplicate logo (Navbar already shows it). Enriched company cards with product chips and snapshot counts. Companies API returns `{name, products, total_snapshots}`.
- ✅ **Portfolio Analytics UI (live data from DB/tape):**
  - Borrowing Base — 4 KPI cards, waterfall table, advance rates by region, facility capacity bar, breaching shops
  - Concentration Limits — summary bar, 2-column grid of limit cards with progress bars + compliance badges + click-to-expand breaching items
  - Covenants — covenant cards with threshold bars, calculation breakdowns, compliance distance warnings, historical evaluation dates
  - Invoices — paginated table (7,697+ rows), eligible/ineligible tabs, search/filter
  - Payments — payment ledger with ADVANCE/PARTIAL/FINAL badges, transaction filters
  - Bank Statements — cash position KPI cards, historical statement list
- ✅ **Phase 2A — PostgreSQL database:**
  - PostgreSQL 18.3 with SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM + Alembic migrations
  - 6 tables: organizations, products, invoices, payments, bank_statements, facility_configs
  - DB-optional mode — app runs without PostgreSQL, falls back to tape data
  - Tape-compatible DataFrame bridge (`core/db_loader.py`) — zero changes to analysis functions
  - Seed script (`scripts/seed_db.py`) to populate DB from existing tape files
- ✅ **Phase 2B — Integration API:**
  - 12 inbound endpoints under `/api/integration/` for portfolio companies to push data
  - X-API-Key authentication (SHA-256 hashed, org-scoped)
  - Invoices: CRUD + bulk create (up to 5,000/request)
  - Payments: create + bulk create, linked to invoices
  - Bank statements: create with optional base64 PDF upload
  - API key generation CLI (`scripts/create_api_key.py`)
- ✅ **Phase 2C — Portfolio computation engine:**
  - `core/portfolio.py` — borrowing base waterfall, concentration limits (4 types, tiered thresholds), covenants (5-6 per asset class), portfolio cash flow
  - Supports both Klaim (receivables factoring) and SILQ (POS lending) asset classes
  - `_portfolio_load()` auto-selects data source (DB → tape fallback)
- ✅ **SILQ Feb 2026 tape onboarded:**
  - Three product types: BNPL, RBF, RCL — consistent across both tapes
  - Loader reads all data sheets and normalises `Loan_Type` → `Product`
  - Portfolio commentary from tape displayed in Overview tab
- ✅ **Ejari RNPL onboarded (read-only summary):**
  - Pre-computed ODS workbook with 13 sheets — no raw loan tape
  - `analysis_type: "ejari_summary"` bypasses normal tape loading, renders dedicated dashboard
  - Parser (`core/analysis_ejari.py`) extracts 12 structured sections from ODS
  - Dashboard (`EjariDashboard.jsx`) renders 12 tabs: Portfolio Overview (KPIs + DPD), Monthly Cohorts, Cohort Loss Waterfall, Roll Rates, Historical Performance, Collections by Month/Origination, Segment Analysis (6 dimensions), Credit Quality Trends, Najiz & Legal, Write-offs & Fraud, Data Notes
  - **Formatting aligned with Klaim/SILQ** — uses shared `KpiCard` (Framer Motion stagger, hover effects, gradient glow, subtitles) and `ChartPanel` wrappers. `AnimatePresence` tab transitions. Local `Kpi`/`Panel` components deleted.
  - **Sidebar navigation** — aligned with Klaim/SILQ design pattern: 12 tabs in left sidebar, URL-driven (`/tape/:slug`), single section rendered per tab. Sidebar header shows "Analysis" (not "Tape Analytics"). Portfolio Analytics section hidden via `hide_portfolio_tabs: true` in config. Executive Summary always visible (decoupled from `hide_portfolio_tabs`).
  - Loader updated to support `.ods` file extension (requires `odfpy` package in venv)
  - Cached parsing — ODS parsed once per session
- ✅ **PAR dual perspective (Tape Analytics):**
  - Active PAR 30+ was 46% (alarming) → Lifetime PAR 30+ is 3.6% (sensible for IC)
  - Active outstanding is only 7.8% of total originated — inflated the active ratio
  - Lifetime shown as headline, Active as context in subtitle
- ✅ **AI Executive Summary page (with holistic narrative):**
  - Single `GET /ai-executive-summary` endpoint computes ALL analytics and asks Claude for both a credit memo narrative AND ranked findings in one call
  - **Narrative section:** Company-specific sections (Ejari: 9 sections, Klaim: 7, SILQ: 6) — each with multi-paragraph analysis, assessment-colored metric pills, and gold conclusion line
  - **Summary table:** Key metrics with RAG-style colored assessment badges (Healthy/Acceptable/Warning/Critical/Monitor)
  - **Bottom line:** Gold-bordered verdict paragraph with specific diligence items for IC
  - **Key findings:** 5-10 ranked findings with severity badges (critical/warning/positive), data points, and "View Tab" navigation (unchanged from before)
  - Section guidance per company type: Ejari (Portfolio Overview → Monthly Cohorts → Loss Waterfall → Roll Rates → Historical Performance → Segment Analysis → Credit Quality → Najiz & Legal → Write-offs & Fraud), Klaim (Portfolio Overview → Cohort Performance → Collection & DSO → Denial & Loss Economics → Recovery & Risk Migration → Concentration & Segments → Forward Signals), SILQ (Portfolio Overview → Delinquency → Collections → Cohorts → Concentration → Yield & Tenure)
  - `max_tokens=8000` (was 2000) to accommodate full narrative + findings
  - Accessible from sidebar above Tape Analytics section (always visible, including Ejari)
  - `_build_ejari_full_context()` extracts portfolio overview, PAR, DPD, cohorts, loss waterfall, roll rates, segments, collections, credit quality, write-offs, legal recovery from parsed ODS
- ✅ **SILQ analytics expansion (3 new tabs):**
  - `compute_silq_seasonality()` — YoY calendar month patterns + seasonal index for POS lending
  - `compute_silq_cohort_loss_waterfall()` — per-vintage: Disbursed → DPD>90 Default → Recovery → Net Loss
  - `compute_silq_underwriting_drift()` — per-vintage quality metrics + z-score drift flags vs 6-month rolling norms
  - All 3 wired into SILQ_CHART_MAP, config.json tabs, frontend chart components, and sidebar
  - SILQ now has 13 tabs (was 9): overview, delinquency, collections, concentration, cohort-analysis, yield-margins, tenure, loss-waterfall, underwriting-drift, seasonality, cdr-ccr, covenants, data-integrity
- ✅ **Unit test coverage expanded:**
  - 134 tests total (66 Klaim + 68 SILQ), all passing
  - Klaim: added PAR dual perspective tests (5 tests)
  - SILQ: added seasonality, cohort loss waterfall, underwriting drift tests (9 tests)

- ✅ **Color scheme aligned to ACP brand:**
  - Base background shifted from `#0C1018` to `#121C27` (ACP navy)
  - All surfaces, borders, and hardcoded colors updated proportionally
  - Warmer, more institutional feel while preserving gold/teal/red/blue semantic palette
- ✅ **Mobile responsiveness (comprehensive, 29 files):**
  - `useBreakpoint` hook — `{ isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop }` via matchMedia listeners
  - `MobileMenuContext` — sidebar drawer coordination (open/close/toggle), route-change auto-close, body scroll lock
  - Sidebar: 240px fixed → slide-in drawer on mobile (fixed position, translateX animation, dark backdrop overlay, close button)
  - Navbar: 80px → 56px on mobile, hamburger menu on company pages, hidden Framework/Live/v0.5 chips, scaled-down logo
  - All KPI grids (`repeat(5,1fr)`, `repeat(4,1fr)`, `repeat(3,1fr)`) → `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(140-150px, 1fr))`
  - All 2-column layouts (`1fr 1fr`) → `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` — single column on mobile
  - PortfolioStatsHero: gap 56px → 12px, values/labels scaled down, dividers hidden, empty Live Portfolio banner hidden on mobile
  - Padding reduced 28px → 14px on all pages for mobile
  - Framework/Methodology: sidebar TOC hidden on mobile (content takes full width)
  - ChartPanel: added `overflowX: auto` for wide table horizontal scrolling
  - CSS tokens: `--navbar-height` responsive variable, table scroll override
  - Desktop layout preserved identically — zero regressions
- ✅ **As-of date fix:** Defaults to snapshot date (from filename), not max deal date in data
- ✅ **Analysis Framework (Phase 0):**
  - `core/ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md` — analytical philosophy document with 5-level hierarchy (Size → Cash Conversion → Credit Quality → Loss Attribution → Forward Signals)
  - 6 sections: Analytical Hierarchy, Metric Dictionary, Tape vs Portfolio Philosophy, Asset Class Adaptations, Leading vs Lagging Indicators, Separation Principle
  - `GET /framework` endpoint serves markdown content
  - `Framework.jsx` — full-page markdown renderer with sticky TOC, accessed via Navbar link

  - Dot indicators (click to manually switch), pause on hover, resume on leave
  - Row 2 adapts: "Facility" row for multi-product (Limit, Merchants, Users) vs "Live Portfolio" for single-product
  - All product summaries fetched (not just first) to populate carousel data
  - Single-product cards (Klaim, SILQ, Ejari) completely unaffected
- ✅ **Research Hub (data room ingestion + dual-engine research):**
  - Data room engine: ingest any directory (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, DOCX), chunk, index, search
  - Claude RAG query engine with source citations
  - NotebookLM bridge rewritten against real `notebooklm-py` v0.3.4 API (was non-functional before)
  - Dual-engine synthesis with citation origin tracking (claude vs notebooklm)
  - Notebook ID + synced source persistence via JSON sidecars (survives restarts)
  - Auto-sync: data room ingest triggers NLM source upload
  - 4 NLM endpoints: status, sync, configure, sources
  - NLM status in Operator Command Center health matrix
  - Rules-based insight extraction at ingest time
  - Analytics snapshots as searchable research sources
  - Frontend: DocumentLibrary, ResearchChat (engine badges, NLM status indicator, sync button, synthesis notes)
  - **Tamara data room ingested** (session 19): 226 files, 5,504 chunks, 2,388 pages, 10 document types classified, Claude RAG synthesis working
  - **Klaim data room ingested** (session 17): 28 docs, 492 chunks, 320 pages

- ✅ **Legal Analysis (third analytical pillar):**
  - 5-pass Claude extraction from facility agreement PDFs
  - Pydantic schemas for all extracted terms
  - 3-tier facility params merge (document > manual > hardcoded)
  - Compliance comparison (extracted vs live analytics)
  - 8-tab frontend dashboard
  - Klaim: 4 documents reviewed, 7 parameter updates from MMA/MRPA

  - First adversarial review: 8 critical, 14 warning, 6 improvement findings across ~50 files
  - Report: `reports/deep-work/2026-04-11-red-team-report.md`, progress: `reports/deep-work/progress.json`
  - **Security:** Path traversal in legal upload fixed (`os.path.basename`), CF_TEAM empty-string auth bypass guarded
  - **Calculation fixes:** Weighted avg discount double-multiply removed, revenue inf guarded, CDR seasoning filter (< 3 months skipped), PAR benchmark uses snapshot date not `now()`
  - **Business logic:** Snapshot index inverted (BB movement/covenant trends), covenant Collection Ratio marked as cumulative approximation, EoD consecutive period validation, amendment covenant dedup prefers later timestamp
  - **AI hardening:** 22 `try/except: pass` blocks replaced with `data_gaps[]` tracking + DATA GAPS section in context, currency added to AI cache key, file mtime in cache key for same-name replacement
  - **Frontend:** Race condition fixed (AbortController), TabInsight/AICommentary cleared on snapshot change, Tamara read-only badge, PortfolioAnalytics data source badge, DataChat empty response handling
  - **Performance:** db_loader N+1 queries → single pre-aggregate, bounded in-memory caches (max 10)
  - All 156 tests passing after fixes
- ✅ **Intelligence System — Self-Learning "Second Brain" (7-phase build, inspired by Claude+Obsidian pattern):**
  - **Phase 0 Foundation:** `core/mind/schema.py` (KnowledgeNode + Relation dataclasses, backward-compatible via metadata._graph), `core/mind/relation_index.py` (bidirectional adjacency list, BFS chain traversal), `core/mind/event_bus.py` (sync pub/sub, disable for tests). master_mind.py + company_mind.py upgraded with graph metadata + event publishing.
  - **Phase 1 Knowledge Graph:** `core/mind/graph.py` — graph-aware query engine with recency/category/graph bonus scoring, supersession exclusion, contradiction penalty. Neighborhood BFS, staleness detection (60d threshold), compaction of superseded chains.
  - **Phase 2 Incremental Compilation:** `core/mind/entity_extractor.py` (regex extraction of 7 entity types from text + tape metrics), `core/mind/compiler.py` (one-input-many-updates: create/supersede/reinforce/contradict pipeline, compilation reports in JSONL, cross-document discrepancy detection).
  - **Phase 3 Closed-Loop Learning:** `core/mind/learning.py` — LearningEngine auto-classifies corrections (tone_shift, threshold_override, data_caveat, factual_error, missing_context, methodology_correction). Rules auto-generated as KnowledgeNodes (node_type="rule"). Pattern extraction groups 3+ similar corrections into codification candidates. Correction frequency tracking by type.
  - **Phase 4 Thesis Tracker:** `core/mind/thesis.py` — InvestmentThesis + ThesisPillar + DriftAlert. Per-company structured theses with measurable pillars linked to computed metrics. Auto-drift detection: holding → weakening (within 10%) → broken (breached). Conviction score 0-100 per company. Versioned thesis log (JSONL). AI context injection as Layer 5.
  - **Phase 5 Proactive Intelligence:** `core/mind/intelligence.py` (cross-company pattern detection: metric trends, risk convergence, covenant pressure across 2+ companies). `core/mind/briefing.py` (morning briefing with urgency-scored priority actions, thesis alerts, learning summary, recommendations). `core/mind/analyst.py` (persistent analyst context: last session, priority companies, IC dates, focus areas).
  - **Phase 6 Session Tracker:** `core/mind/session.py` — tracks tapes/docs/corrections/rules per session, persists to `reports/session_state.json`, delta computation for "since last session" briefings.
  - **Phase 7 Queryable KB:** `core/mind/kb_decomposer.py` (parses lessons.md entries + CLAUDE.md decisions into linked KnowledgeNodes with stable IDs and topic tags). `core/mind/kb_query.py` (unified search across mind entries + lessons + decisions + entity nodes with text/metadata/tag scoring).
  - **Event Listeners:** `core/mind/listeners.py` — wires TAPE_INGESTED → metric compilation + thesis drift check, DOCUMENT_INGESTED → entity extraction + compilation, MEMO_EDITED → learning rule generation, CORRECTION_RECORDED → correction analysis.
  - **6 Slash Commands:** `/morning` (session-start briefing), `/thesis {company}` (create/review thesis), `/drift` (check all theses), `/learn` (review corrections + auto-rules), `/emerge` (cross-company patterns), `/know {question}` (KB search).
  - **Tests:** 93 new tests (42 foundation + 51 system), all 249 total passing.
  - **Architecture:** JSONL-first (no migration), lazy schema upgrade, event bus with disable() for test isolation, backward-compatible metadata._graph storage. File-based, no new PostgreSQL dependency.
- ✅ **Intelligence System — Backend Integration (wired into live app):**
  - **Event wiring:** `register_all_listeners()` called at app startup. 4 events fire from live endpoints: TAPE_INGESTED (deduped per session), DOCUMENT_INGESTED (from dataroom engine), MEMO_EDITED (with old content for learning), CORRECTION_RECORDED (from chat feedback).
  - **Layer 5 AI context:** `build_mind_context()` now assembles 5 layers (was 4). Layer 5 = ThesisTracker.get_ai_context(). All 4 `_build_*_full_context()` functions benefit automatically. Backward-compatible (empty string when no thesis exists).
  - **10 API endpoints in `backend/intelligence.py`:** thesis CRUD + drift check + log, morning briefing, KB search, learning summary + rules, chat feedback. Router registered in main.py.
  - **OperatorCenter:** 7 tabs (was 5) — added Briefing (priority cards, thesis alerts, recommendations, learning summary) and Learning (correction frequency, auto-rules, codification candidates).
  - **DataChat feedback:** Thumbs up/down buttons on AI responses. Thumbs-down fires CORRECTION_RECORDED, records in CompanyMind.
  - **263 tests passing** (was 249 — 14 NLM tests added in prior session).
- ✅ **Klaim Data Room + Memo Exercise (session 17):**
  - **Legal Analysis tabs** — all 8 validated rendering with extracted data from 4 facility PDFs
  - **Account Debtor validation** — confirmed tape lacks payer column (Group = 143 providers, not 13 approved insurance payers). Recorded in Company Mind.
  - **Consecutive breach history** — `annotate_covenant_eod()` + `covenant_history.json` verified working per MMA 18.3
  - **Klaim data room ingested** — 87 files from `data/klaim/dataroom/`, 1,720 chunks, 1,334 pages. Intelligence System events fired (entity extraction + compilation).
  - **Klaim Credit Memo** — 12 AI sections with dual-engine research (Claude RAG + NotebookLM). Full 5-layer context pipeline. Renders in MemoEditor.
  - **Tamara Credit Memo** — 11/12 AI sections (covenant list-vs-dict bug fixed in analytics_bridge.py)
- ✅ **Data room engine moved to company level:**
  - Path: `data/{company}/dataroom/` (was `data/{company}/{product}/dataroom/`)
  - `_dataroom_dir()` updated in engine.py, analytics_snapshot.py, notebooklm_bridge.py
  - `dataroom` excluded from product discovery in `get_products()`
  - Default ingest source: `data/{company}/dataroom/` (removed OneDrive fallback)
  - `_EXCLUDE_DIRS` now blocks `chunks`/`analytics` subdirs instead of "dataroom" itself
- ✅ **NLM unavailability warning system (replaces silent degradation):**
  - `NotebookLMEngine.get_warning()` — structured warning with code, message, fix instructions
  - `DualResearchEngine.query()` includes `nlm_warning` in response when NLM unavailable
  - `dataroom/ingest` endpoint includes NLM sync warning in `nlm_sync` object
  - **ResearchChat.jsx**: blocking NLMWarningBanner on first query — "Proceed without NLM" / "Retry Connection" buttons, session-level dismissal
  - **DocumentLibrary.jsx**: NLM sync status strip after ingest (teal success / amber warning with fix)
  - 5 new tests (268 total, all passing)
- ✅ **Bug fixes (session 17):**
  - `core/loader.py`: Added `covenant_history.json`, `facility_params.json`, `debtor_validation.json` to `_EXCLUDE` (was crashing snapshot sort with None date)
  - `core/loader.py`: Added `_NON_PRODUCT_DIRS` set to exclude `dataroom`, `_master_mind`, `mind` from product discovery
  - `core/memo/analytics_bridge.py`: `isinstance()` check for list vs dict covenant triggers (Tamara uses list, Klaim uses dict)
  - `backend/main.py`: Null-safe sort in `list_companies` (`date or '0000-00-00'`)
- ✅ **Document Library enhancements (session 17):**
  - Category filter chips: clickable pills per document_type with colored borders (gold=Facility Agreement, blue=Company Presentation, teal=Business Plan, purple=Portfolio Tape, gray=Other)
  - Category badges on cards replace generic "FILE" label — human-readable names ("Facility Agreement" not "FACILITY_AGREEMENT")
  - Sort dropdown: Name, Category, Pages, Date Ingested
  - Folder breadcrumbs: last 2 folder segments from filepath shown in italic below filename
  - File viewing: PDF cards clickable, open in new browser tab via `GET /dataroom/documents/{id}/view` endpoint (streams original file with correct MIME type)
  - Text length shown in card metadata (e.g. "18.4K chars")
  - Results count when filtered ("Showing 3 of 87 documents in Company Presentation")
- ✅ **Direct DPD from Expected collection days (session 17 continued):**
  - `compute_par()`: when `Expected collection days` column available, computes `DPD = max(0, today - (Deal date + Expected collection days))` per deal. Replaces shortfall proxy. Method reported as `direct` vs `proxy`. Falls back to proxy for older tapes.
  - `compute_dso()`: DSO Operational = `true_dso - Expected collection days` per deal (was crude `median_term * 0.5` proxy)
  - `compute_klaim_covenants()` Paid vs Due: temporal filtering — only counts deals with expected payment date in period (was all deals with Deal date in period)
  - April 15 tape loaded: 8,080 deals (full portfolio), 65 columns, 5 new incl Expected collection days. Direct DPD working. PAR30 covenant breached (36.6% vs 7% threshold).

- [x] Replace hardcoded FX rates with live API (exchangerate-api.com, fallback to hardcoded)
- [x] Startup script — `start.ps1` boots both servers + opens browser
- [x] Design elevation — Framer Motion animations, card hover effects, skeleton loading, micro-interactions
- [x] Color scheme — shifted to ACP-aligned warmer navy (`#121C27` base)
- [x] As-of date fix — defaults to snapshot date, not max deal date
- [x] Analysis Framework — 5-level analytical hierarchy document + Framework page with sticky TOC
- [x] 6 new tape analytics tabs — Loss Waterfall, Recovery Analysis, Collections Timing, Underwriting Drift, Segment Analysis, Seasonality
- [x] PAR (Portfolio at Risk) KPIs — 3-method computation, Overview KPI cards
- [x] DTFC (Days to First Cash) — leading indicator on Overview
- [x] DSO Operational variant — days from expected due date to collection
- [x] HHI time series — concentration trend across all snapshots
- [x] Loss categorization — rules-based heuristic classification
- [x] Separation Principle — clean vs loss portfolio isolation
- [x] Methodology transparency log — data corrections and column availability audit trail
**Phase 2 — Borrowing Base Monitoring ✅ COMPLETE:**
- [x] PostgreSQL 18.3 database + SQLAlchemy ORM + Alembic migrations
- [x] Integration API (12 endpoints) with X-API-Key auth
- [x] Portfolio computation engine (borrowing base, concentration, covenants)
- [x] DB-optional fallback to tape data
- [x] Frontend: 6 portfolio tabs with live data
- [x] Seed script + API key generation CLI
**Analytical Framework Expansion ✅ COMPLETE (from Ejari/RNPL deep-dive — applied to ALL companies):**
- [x] PAR as headline Overview KPIs — dual perspective (active + lifetime), 3-method computation, Option C with "Derived" labeling
- [x] Collections timing waterfall — timing bucket distribution using collection curve columns (tab 15)
- [x] Cohort loss waterfall — per-vintage: Originated → Gross Default → Recovery → Net Loss (tab 13)
- [x] Credit quality / underwriting drift — per-vintage quality metrics + z-score drift flags (tab 16)
- [x] Enhanced segment analysis — multi-dimensional cuts: product, provider_size, deal_size, new_repeat (tab 17)
- [x] Roll rate enhancement — roll-rate matrix + cure rates in Risk & Migration tab (tab 11)
- [x] Recovery analysis post-default — recovery rates, timing, worst/best deals by vintage (tab 14)
- [x] Historical vintage performance curves — vintage loss curves in Loss Waterfall tab
- [x] Write-off / loss isolation — Separation Principle (`separate_portfolio()`) splits clean vs loss
- [x] Fraud/anomaly categorization — rules-based heuristics (provider_issue, coding_error, credit/underwriting)
- [x] HHI time series — concentration trend across all snapshots with trend detection + warnings
- [x] DTFC (Days to First Cash) — curve-based + estimated methods, median + P90 on Overview
- [x] DSO dual variants — DSO Capital + DSO Operational (weighted + median)
- [x] Seasonality dashboard — YoY comparison by calendar month + seasonal index (tab 18)
- [x] Methodology transparency — data corrections log, column availability audit trail
- [x] **Analysis Framework document expansion** — formalized: Analytical Hierarchy, Metric Doctrine (denominator/weighting/confidence), Three Clocks, Collection Rate Disambiguation, Dilution Framework, Denominator Discipline, Methodology Onboarding Guide with hierarchy-level mapping. Served via Framework page with sticky TOC.
- [x] **Company Methodology page updates** — Klaim: added PAR (dual denominator, 3 methods), Loss Waterfall (default def, categorization, recovery), Forward-Looking Signals (DTFC, HHI time series, DSO dual perspectives), Advanced Analytics (collections timing, underwriting drift, segment analysis, seasonality). Validation section updated with anomaly detection docs.
**Key analytical design decisions (documented for consistency):**
- PAR denominator: active outstanding (Tape), eligible outstanding (Portfolio). Lifetime rates live in Loss Waterfall as "Gross/Net Default Rate" — different metric, different location.
- PAR without contractual benchmarks: hide (graceful degradation), not estimate. Exception: Option C (empirical curves from completed deals) with explicit "Derived" labeling when robust enough (min N completed deals, min vintage depth).
- Tape Analytics = retrospective, IC-ready analysis. Portfolio Analytics = live monitoring, facility-grade.
- Completed-only metrics for margins/returns. Outstanding-based metrics for ageing/health (not face value).
- Separation principle: clean portfolio for performance metrics, loss portfolio isolated for attribution.
- Denominator discipline: every metric declares total vs active vs eligible. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 6.
- Three clocks: origination age, contractual DPD, operational delay. New asset classes must declare which clock drives delinquency. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 7.
- Collection rate = GLR (all cash vs face). CRR (capital recovery) shown separately in Returns. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 8.
- Dilution (non-credit loss) reframed for Klaim: denial = dilution by reason code. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 9.
- Metric doctrine: every metric must declare formula, denominator, weighting, inclusion, clock, confidence grade. See ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md Section 10.
**Portfolio Analytics — Near-term enhancements:**
- [x] Trigger distance + projected breach date on Covenants tab — headroom line (teal ✓) when compliant, projected breach date (amber ⚠) when trend moving toward limit, ↘/↗ direction vs prior snapshot
- [x] Facility params input UI (edit advance rates, concentration limits, covenants from frontend) — FacilityParamsPanel.jsx + backend endpoints complete

## .env Safety Checklist (run if unsure)
```powershell
# Check if .env is in .gitignore
Select-String -Path .gitignore -Pattern "\.env"
# Check if .env is being tracked by git
git ls-files .env
# If this returns ".env", it's tracked and must be removed:
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m 'Remove .env from tracking'
git push origin main
```
**PowerShell git commit note:** Always use single quotes for commit messages in PowerShell:
```powershell
git commit -m 'your message here'
```
