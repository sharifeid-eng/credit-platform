## What This Project Is
**Laith** (with **AI** as a play in the name) — an institutional-grade, full-stack web application for analyzing and monitoring asset-backed loan portfolios. Built for a private credit fund (ACP) that purchases receivables and short-term loans from portfolio companies.
The platform allows analysts and investment committee members to:
- Upload loan tape snapshots (CSV/Excel) and explore portfolio performance
- Run automated data integrity checks across snapshots
- View interactive dashboards with per-company analysis tabs (Klaim: 12 tabs, SILQ: 8 tabs — bespoke per asset class)
- Generate AI-powered portfolio commentary and ask natural language questions about the data
-----
## Branding
- **Platform name:** Laith (لَيث — Arabic for "lion"; the AI in L-**AI**-th is intentional)
- **Logo:** Styled text logo built into components (gold "AI" highlight in "LAITH" + 🦁 icon mark)
- **Logo component:** `LaithLogo` exported from `Navbar.jsx`, used in Navbar (Home page removed duplicate)
- **Page title:** `Laith — Data Analytics` (set in `frontend/index.html` and Navbar)
- **Note:** Original SVG at `frontend/public/logo.svg` has white background, not suitable for dark theme. Using styled component instead.
-----
## Business Context
**Who uses it:** Sharif (fund analyst/PM) and eventually the broader investment committee.
**Current portfolio companies:**
- **Klaim** — medical insurance claims factoring, UAE. Data in AED. Live dataset: `data/klaim/UAE_healthcare/`
- **SILQ** — POS lending (BNPL & RBF), KSA. Data in SAR. Live dataset: `data/SILQ/KSA/`
**Asset classes:** Receivables (insurance claims factoring) and short-term consumer/POS loans.
**Data format:** Single Excel or CSV loan tapes, typically thousands to tens of thousands of rows. Each row is a deal/receivable. Snapshots are taken periodically (e.g. monthly) and named `YYYY-MM-DD_description.csv`.
**Data notes:**
- **Tapes available:** Sep 2025 (25 cols), Dec 2025 (xlsx), Feb 2026 (25 cols), Mar 2026 (60 cols — latest)
- Sep 2025 tape has `Expected IRR` and `Actual IRR` columns; Dec 2025 and Feb 2026 do not
- Mar 2026 tape restored IRR and added 35 new columns: collection curves (26 cols for expected/actual at 30d intervals up to 390d), `Owner`, `Released from`, `Collected till date by owner`, VAT columns, `FundStatus`
- `Actual IRR for owner` column in Mar 2026 tape has **garbage data** (mean ~2.56e44) — excluded from all analysis
- All tapes have `Discount` column (values range 1%–41%, concentrated at 4–7%)
- `New business` column available for new vs repeat analysis
- Fee columns: `Setup fee`, `Other fee`, `Adjustments`
- Loss tracking: `Provisions`, `Denied by insurance`
- **Column availability drives feature visibility** — features gracefully degrade (hidden, not estimated) on older tapes

**SILQ data notes:**
- **Tape available:** Jan 2026 (xlsx, 3 sheets — "Portfolio Commentary" + "BNPL+RBF_NE" + "RBF_LT")
- **1,915 loans total** (multi-sheet), 19 columns per sheet, SAR currency
- 3 products: `BNPL` (969 loans), `RBF_Exc` (943 loans from RBF_LT sheet), `RBF_NE` (3 loans)
- Column names include currency suffix: `Disbursed_Amount (SAR)`, `Outstanding_Amount (SAR)`, etc.
- 3 statuses: `Closed`, `CURRENT`, `OVERDUE` (normalised to title case by loader)
- Total disbursed: SAR 325.2M, Outstanding: SAR 76.2M
- **RBF_LT sheet lacks `Margin Collected` column** — revenue is structured differently in RBF (baked into repayment). Loader fills with 0.0 and marks `_margin_synthetic = True`. Yield tab shows info note.
- Portfolio Commentary sheet contains company-written narrative — displayed in Overview tab
- DPD computed as `max(0, ref_date - Repayment_Deadline)`, 0 for Closed loans. **ref_date = tape date or as-of date** (not today's date)
- `Outstanding_Amount` can exceed `Disbursed_Amount` (includes accrued margin) — not a data error
- **PAR methodology:** GBV-weighted (Outstanding of DPD>X loans / Total Outstanding of active loans), NOT count-based
- **Backward-date caveat:** When as-of date < tape date, balance columns (outstanding, collected, overdue, margins) still reflect tape date. Only deal selection is filtered. Dashboard shows warning banner + per-KPI ⚠ markers on stale metrics.
-----
## Long-Term Vision (3 Phases)
**Two distinct modes in one platform, each with its own data source:**
- **Tape Analytics** — data from CSV/Excel loan tapes uploaded manually by the analyst. Backward-looking, point-in-time deep analysis. Bespoke per asset class. Analyst-driven. This is the proprietary edge.
- **Portfolio Analytics** — data from a persistent database fed by inbound API from portfolio companies (invoices, payments, bank statements pushed in real-time). Forward-looking, continuous facility monitoring. Competes with / replaces Cascade Debt and Creditit for ACP's specific needs.

Both systems coexist on the same sidebar. A company can have both: historical tapes for trend analysis AND live API data for borrowing base monitoring. Tape snapshots also serve as a reconciliation source to validate API-fed data.

**Current state:** Computation engine + dashboard are built and working. Currently reads from tape data as a stopgap. The database (Phase 2A) and integration API (Phase 2B) are needed to unlock the real-time, API-driven architecture.

### Phase 1 — Tape Analytics ✅ (current)
- Manual file upload workflow (CSV/Excel loan tapes)
- AI-powered dashboards per company/product (Klaim: 12 tabs, SILQ: 9 tabs)
- Consistency checks across snapshots
- Investment committee-ready commentary
- Bespoke analysis per asset class (receivables factoring vs POS lending)
### Phase 2 — Portfolio Analytics (Borrowing Base Monitoring)
**Data source: persistent database fed by inbound integration API from portfolio companies (not tape files).**
Portfolio Analytics is the real-time counterpart to Tape Analytics. Portfolio companies push invoices, payments, and bank statements via API; the system computes borrowing base, concentration limits, and covenants continuously.

**Status:**
- ✅ **2C — Computation engine** (`core/portfolio.py`, 1139 lines). Borrowing base waterfall, concentration limits, covenants for SILQ + Klaim. Auto-dispatch via `config.analysis_type`. Currently reads from tape data as a stopgap for validation against compliance certs.
- ✅ **2D — Dashboard wired to backend APIs**. All 3 portfolio tabs (Borrowing Base, Concentration Limits, Covenants) fetch live computed data from 6 backend endpoints. No more mock data.
- **Not started — 2A: PostgreSQL database.** Schema needed: `organizations`, `invoices`, `payments`, `bank_statements`, `facility_config`. Replaces file-based storage for portfolio data.
- **Not started — 2B: Integration API.** Inbound endpoints for portfolio companies to push data (`/api/integration/invoices`, `/payments`, `/bank-statements`). X-API-Key auth per organization. Bulk operations (up to 5,000 per request).
- **Not started — 2.7: Feature gap pages.** Invoices page (eligible/ineligible split), Payments page (transaction ledger), Bank Statements page (cash verification + upload), Concentration breach drill-down, Covenant historical date selector.

**Reference:** Full implementation plan in `API_Integration_Guide_Updated.docx` (Sharif's Desktop). Covers Creditit analysis, architecture, DB schema, API endpoints, computation engine, dashboard connection, feature gaps, timeline, and portfolio company communication framework.

### Phase 3 — Deployment & Team Access
- Cloud deployment on Railway (~$5/mo) — always-on, no laptop dependency
- Role-based access (analyst vs IC vs read-only)
- Scheduled report delivery
- Accounting reports upload (P&L, Balance Sheet PDFs from portfolio companies)
-----
## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (`localhost:8000`), Pandas, Anthropic API (`claude-opus-4-6`), ReportLab (PDF)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Recharts, React Router, Axios (`localhost:5173`)
- **AI:** Anthropic API — portfolio commentary, per-tab insights, data chat, PDF integrity reports
- **PDF Reports:** Playwright (headless Chrome) for dashboard screenshots + ReportLab for PDF composition
- **Data:** CSV/Excel files stored locally under `data/`
-----
## How to Start the App (Every Session)
**One command (recommended):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\SharifEid\credit-platform
.\start.ps1
```
Opens two terminal windows (backend + frontend) and launches the browser automatically.

**Manual start (if needed):**
- Terminal 1 — Backend: `cd credit-platform && venv\Scripts\activate && cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Terminal 2 — Frontend: `cd credit-platform\frontend && npm run dev`
- Then open `http://localhost:5173`

## Navigation Architecture
**Hierarchy:** Company → Product → (Tape Analytics | Portfolio Analytics)

**Route structure:**
| Route | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `Home` | Landing page — company grid |
| `/company/:co/:product/tape/:tab` | `TapeAnalytics` | 12-tab dashboard (tab slug in URL) |
| `/company/:co/:product/portfolio/:tab` | `PortfolioAnalytics` | 3-tab portfolio view (live data) |
| `/company/:co/:product/methodology` | `Methodology` | Definitions & formulas reference |

**Sidebar navigation:** 240px persistent sidebar on all company pages. Sections: Company name, Products (if multiple), Tape Analytics (12 links), Portfolio Analytics (3 links), Methodology. Active state: gold left border + gold text.

**URL-based tabs:** Active tab driven by `:tab` URL param (not React state). Users can bookmark/share specific views. Slugs: `overview`, `actual-vs-expected`, `deployment`, `collection`, `denial-trend`, `ageing`, `revenue`, `portfolio-tab`, `cohort-analysis`, `returns`, `risk-migration`, `data-integrity`, `borrowing-base`, `concentration-limits`, `covenants`.

**Backward compat:** `/company/:co` and `/company/:co/:product` redirect to `tape/overview`.

**State management:** `CompanyContext` provides shared state (company, products, snapshots, config, currency, summary, etc.) consumed by both TapeAnalytics and PortfolioAnalytics.

## Portfolio Analytics Tabs (3) — Live Data
|Tab                  |What It Shows                                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Borrowing Base       |4 KPI cards, waterfall table (gross → eligible → BB), advance rates by segment, facility capacity bar|
|Concentration Limits |Summary bar (compliant/breach counts), 2-column grid of limit cards with progress bars|
|Covenants            |Covenant cards with threshold bars, calculation breakdowns, compliance badges|

**Data source:** Real-time computation from loan tape data via `core/portfolio.py`. Auto-dispatches to SILQ or Klaim computation based on `config.analysis_type`. Frontend fetches from `/portfolio/borrowing-base`, `/portfolio/concentration-limits`, `/portfolio/covenants` endpoints.
-----
## Currency System
Supported: `AED (0.2723)`, `USD (1.0)`, `EUR (1.08)`, `GBP (1.27)`, `SAR (0.2667)`, `KWD (3.26)`.
Each product has a `config.json` with its reported currency. Frontend shows toggle between reported currency and USD. Backend applies multiplier via `apply_multiplier()` in `core/analysis.py`.
FX rates are fetched live on backend startup (with hardcoded fallback if API unavailable).
-----
## Dashboard Customization Philosophy
Each company/product has its own configured dashboard. The platform shares a common shell but specific views, metrics, and AI prompts are driven by asset class and available columns. Onboarding a new company requires designing the right views for that asset class.
**Current implementation:** Two asset classes live — Klaim (healthcare receivables, 12 tape tabs) and SILQ (POS lending, 9 tape tabs). `core/portfolio.py` auto-dispatches to asset-class-specific computations via `config.analysis_type`.
-----
## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Multi-company dispatch** — `config.json` has `analysis_type` field (`"klaim"` or `"silq"`) that routes endpoints to the correct analysis module. `_get_analysis_type()` helper in `main.py`. Each company has its own `core/analysis_*.py` and `core/validation_*.py`.
- **Per-product tab config** — `config.json` has `tabs` array driving `Sidebar.jsx` dynamically. Falls back to `DEFAULT_TAPE_TABS` (Klaim's 12 tabs) when no `tabs` in config.
- **SILQ chart routing** — Generic `/charts/silq/{chart_name}` endpoint dispatches via `SILQ_CHART_MAP` dict to the correct compute function.
- **Multi-sheet Excel loading** — `core/loader.py` has `load_silq_snapshot()` for SILQ: loads all data sheets, separates Portfolio Commentary, normalises columns (Loan_Type→Product, status to title case, Shop_ID to str), fills missing `Margin Collected` with 0.0 + `_margin_synthetic` flag, and `pd.concat`s into one DataFrame. Original `load_snapshot()` for Klaim picks the sheet with most data rows. Both detect malformed headers (all numeric/Unnamed columns) and reload with `header=1`.
- **DPD ref_date** — `_dpd(df, ref_date)` uses tape date or as-of date, not today. All compute functions pass `ref_date` through. This ensures PAR/DPD metrics reflect the correct point in time.
- **PAR methodology** — All SILQ PAR ratios are GBV-weighted: `Outstanding of DPD>X / Total Outstanding of active loans`. Klaim uses GBV-weighted collection/denial/pending rates. Klaim PD (Expected Loss) is intentionally count-based (probability metric).
- **Backward-date caveat system** — `CompanyContext` stores `snapshotDate` from date-range API and derives `isBackdated = asOfDate < snapshotDate`. When true: `BackdatedBanner.jsx` renders a gold warning bar below controls; `KpiCard.jsx` accepts `stale` prop showing ⚠ icon on balance-derived KPIs. Overview tabs (both Klaim and SILQ) mark stale vs accurate KPIs.
- **`core/analysis.py`** — Klaim pure data computation. No FastAPI, no I/O.
- **`core/analysis_silq.py`** — SILQ pure data computation. Column aliases map short names to actual names with currency suffix (e.g., `C_DISBURSED = 'Disbursed_Amount (SAR)'`). `_safe()` converts numpy types for JSON serialization.
- **`core/config.py`** — per-product `config.json` stores currency, description, analysis_type, and tabs.
- **Snapshot naming** — files must start with `YYYY-MM-DD_` for date parsing.
- **`filter_by_date()`** — filters deals to `Deal date <= as_of_date`.
- **`_load()` in main.py** — matches snapshots by `filename` or `date` field (fixed Feb 2026).
- **AICommentary caching** — stored in `CompanyContext` state, survives tab switches, clears on snapshot change.
- **API response extraction** — `api.js` extracts: `.commentary` for AI commentary, `.insight` for tab insights, `.answer` for chat responses.
- **Text contrast** — `--text-muted` updated from `#4A5568` to `#8494A7` for readability on dark theme.
- **IRR derivation** — backend calculates IRR for tapes that lack IRR columns (derived from purchase price, collected, deal dates).
- All AI calls use `claude-opus-4-6`.
- **`core/migration.py`** — multi-snapshot roll-rate analysis. Requires ≥2 snapshots. Matches deals by ID column across tapes.
- **`core/validation.py`** — single-tape integrity checks (dupes, date sanity, negatives, nulls, logical consistency).
- **Risk migration endpoint** — auto-selects the two most recent snapshots for comparison. Also bundles stress test + EL model results.
- **Data Integrity tab** — two-step workflow: Run Checks (fast, no API cost) → Generate AI Report (Claude API call). Results, reports, and notes cached as JSON files in `reports/{company}_{product}/`. Auto-loads cached results on tab load. Notes saved with 500ms debounce.
- **Data Chat history** — frontend sends `{role: 'ai', text: '...'}`, backend maps to Anthropic format `{role: 'assistant', content: '...'}`. Reads both `text` and `content` fields for compatibility.
- **Data Chat enriched context** — system prompt includes 7+ pre-computed data sections beyond basic KPIs: group performance (top 8 providers with collection/denial/DSO), active portfolio health (ageing buckets), DSO metrics, returns & margins, discount band performance, new vs repeat business, HHI concentration, plus (when available) IRR summary, collection speed by vintage, and owner/SPV allocation. Fallback instruction directs analysts to the full tape or deal team for deal-level questions.
- **Graceful degradation pattern** — new features that depend on Mar 2026 columns (curves, owner, IRR) check `if 'column' in df.columns` and return `{'available': False}` when missing. Frontend checks `.available` and hides sections entirely — no estimates, no placeholders.
- **DSO fix (Mar 2026)** — old method used `today - Deal date` (just deal age). New curve-based method uses `_estimate_dso_from_curves()` to find when 90% of collected amount arrived, interpolating between 30-day intervals. Returns `available: False` on tapes without curve columns.
- **Collection curves** — `compute_collection_curves()` aggregates expected/actual at 30-day intervals. Backend endpoint retained but **removed from dashboard** — aggregate view blends vintages at different life stages, making it misleading for IC audiences. Per-vintage collection speed is better served by the Cohort table (90d/180d/360d columns).
- **Owner/SPV breakdown** — `compute_owner_breakdown()` groups by `Owner` column, uses `Collected till date by owner` when available (450 deals differ from standard `Collected till date`).
- **`Actual IRR for owner`** — **excluded** from all analysis. Column has garbage data (mean ~2.56e44, likely parsing errors in source data).
- **Outstanding amount pattern** — Ageing and Portfolio health charts use `outstanding = PV - Collected - Denied` (clipped at 0) instead of face value. Shows actual risk exposure. Health `percentage` based on outstanding share.
- **Completed-only margins** — All margin calculations in Returns use completed deals only to avoid penalising vintages still collecting. `realised_margin` = `completed_margin`. Discount band, new vs repeat, and monthly margins also filtered to completed.
- **Expected collection rate** — Collection velocity endpoint returns `expected_rate = Expected till date / Purchase value` per month when column available (`has_forecast` flag). Frontend renders as blue dashed line alongside actual rate bars.
- **Sidebar navigation architecture** — Company pages use a persistent 240px sidebar (`Sidebar.jsx`) within `CompanyLayout`. Tabs are `<Link>` elements (not buttons). Active state: gold left border + text. Sidebar follows Methodology page's original pattern.
- **URL-based tab navigation** — Active tab stored in URL `:tab` param, not React state. Enables bookmarking/sharing. `TapeAnalytics` reads `useParams().tab`, maps slug to label via `SLUG_TO_LABEL`.
- **CompanyContext** — Central state provider extracted from old `Company.jsx`. Both `TapeAnalytics` and `PortfolioAnalytics` consume via `useCompany()` hook. Prevents re-fetches when switching between tape and portfolio views.
- **CompanyLayout** — Wraps `CompanyProvider` around `Sidebar` + `<Outlet>`. Simple flex layout: sidebar (240px fixed) + main content area (flex: 1).
- **Portfolio Analytics engine** — `core/portfolio.py` (1139 lines) computes borrowing base, concentration limits, and covenants for both SILQ and Klaim. Auto-dispatches via `config.analysis_type`. Frontend fetches live data from 6 portfolio API endpoints. Facility params (corporate-level data) persist as JSON in `data/{company}/{product}/facility_params.json`. **Current data source: tape files (stopgap).** End-state: PostgreSQL database fed by inbound integration API from portfolio companies (Phase 2A/2B).
- **PDF report generation** — `generate_report.py` uses Playwright headless Chrome to screenshot all 11 tape tabs (excluding Data Integrity) via sidebar link navigation. Navigates to `/company/:co/:product/tape/:slug` URLs. ReportLab composes a professional PDF (dark cover page with LAITH branding, TOC, full-width tab screenshots). Backend `POST /generate-report` endpoint runs the script as a subprocess, streams the PDF via `FileResponse`, and auto-deletes the temp file via `BackgroundTask`. Frontend receives blob, creates `blob://` URL, opens in new tab. Nothing saved to disk — user saves manually from Chrome's PDF viewer. Playwright falls back to `channel="chrome"` (local Chrome) if managed Chromium is unavailable.
- **PDF report wait strategy** — 3-phase approach per tab: 4s initial mount wait → poll for "Loading..." spinners to disappear (max 20s, double-confirm) → 2s animation settle. ~6.5s per tab, ~70s total.

  - Returns tab: all margins (portfolio, monthly, discount bands, new vs repeat) now computed on completed deals only — Realised Margin 5.27% (was −4.16%). Added Capital Recovery KPI (95.84%)
  - Collection tab: added Expected Rate line (blue dashed) showing `Expected till date / Purchase value` per vintage — contextualises the rate cliff for recent months
- ✅ **One-click PDF Report** — gold "PDF Report" button in dashboard controls bar:
  - Playwright headless Chrome screenshots all 11 tabs (excl. Data Integrity)
  - ReportLab composes professional PDF: dark cover page (LAITH branding), TOC, tab pages with headers/footers
  - Streaming response — no files saved to disk; PDF opens in new browser tab as blob URL
  - Button states: idle (gold outline), generating (grey + spinner), error (red + retry)
  - ~70s generation time, 13-page ~2MB PDF
- ✅ **Sidebar navigation + URL-based routing** — Company pages use persistent sidebar with Tape Analytics (12 tabs) + Portfolio Analytics (3 tabs) + Methodology. Tabs are URL-driven (`/tape/:slug`, `/portfolio/:slug`), bookmarkable. Old horizontal tab bar replaced.
- ✅ **CompanyContext + CompanyLayout** — Shared state provider (`CompanyContext.jsx`) consumed by all company pages. `CompanyLayout.jsx` renders sidebar + `<Outlet>`. Extracted from old `Company.jsx` (deleted).
- ✅ **Landing page cleanup** — Removed duplicate logo (Navbar already shows it). Enriched company cards with product chips and snapshot counts. Companies API returns `{name, products, total_snapshots}`.
- ✅ **Portfolio Analytics (live data):**
  - `core/portfolio.py` — computation engine (1139 lines) with auto-dispatch for SILQ and Klaim
  - 6 backend API endpoints: borrowing-base, concentration-limits, covenants, flow, facility-params (GET + POST)
  - Frontend wired to real APIs — Borrowing Base, Concentration Limits, Covenants tabs show live computed data
  - SILQ: DPD-based ineligibility, tiered concentration (per facility size), 5 covenants (PAR30/90, collection ratio, repayment at term, LTV)
  - Klaim: Outstanding-based waterfall, 5 concentration limits (single receivable, top-10, customer, payer, extended age), 6 covenants
  - Facility params persistence (corporate-level data: facility limit, drawn, cash balance, advance rates)
- ✅ **SILQ onboarded** — full multi-company architecture:
  - `core/analysis_silq.py` — 8 compute functions (summary, delinquency, collections, concentration, cohorts, yield, tenure, borrowing base)
  - `core/validation_silq.py` — SILQ-specific data quality checks
  - `core/loader.py` — multi-sheet Excel support, malformed header detection
  - Backend dispatch via `analysis_type` in config.json → SILQ-specific logic for summary, charts, validation, AI commentary, AI tab insight, chat
  - 7 SILQ chart endpoints under `/charts/silq/{chart_name}`
  - 6 frontend chart components in `components/charts/silq/`
  - Dynamic sidebar tabs from config.json (8 SILQ tabs vs 12 Klaim tabs)
  - `TapeAnalytics.jsx` dispatches to `SilqTabContent` or `KlaimTabContent` based on `analysisType`
  - SILQ Overview with 10 bespoke KPIs (PAR30/60/90, HHI shop, avg tenure, etc.)
  - AI commentary and Data Chat with SILQ-specific prompts and enriched context
  - Currency toggle SAR ↔ USD working
  - Jan 2026 tape: 1,915 loans (3 sheets), 3 products (BNPL + RBF_Exc + RBF_NE), SAR 325.2M disbursed
- ✅ **Multi-sheet SILQ loader** — loads all data sheets from Excel, normalises columns across BNPL and RBF_LT sheets, extracts Portfolio Commentary text
- ✅ **Portfolio Commentary panel** — company-written narrative from tape's Commentary sheet displayed in SILQ Overview
- ✅ **GBV-weighted PAR** — all SILQ PAR ratios (6 calculation sites) corrected from count-based to Outstanding Amount-weighted
- ✅ **DPD ref-date fix** — `_dpd()` uses tape/as-of date instead of today; PAR90 now matches Commentary's SAR 1.10M exactly
- ✅ **RBF margin note** — info note on Yield tab explaining RBF_Exc 0% margin (source sheet lacks Margin Collected column)
- ✅ **Backward-date caveat system** — gold warning banner + per-KPI ⚠ stale indicators when as-of date < tape date. Marks balance-derived metrics (outstanding, collected, overdue, rates, margins) while leaving accurate metrics (disbursed, counts, tenure, discount) unmarked
- ✅ **Compliance certificate reconciliation** — verified dashboard data aligns with company Commentary (Jan 31) and Dec 2025 compliance cert (methodology differences documented)
- ✅ **Unit tests** — 99 tests across `tests/test_analysis_silq.py` (59) and `tests/test_analysis_klaim.py` (40). Covers all compute functions, DPD logic, GBV-weighted PAR, compliance cert reconciliation, Commentary alignment, covenant monitoring. Run: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- ✅ **Live FX rates** — `core/config.py` fetches from `open.er-api.com` (free, no key). 1-hour cache, automatic fallback to hardcoded rates. `GET /fx-rates` endpoint returns rates + source (`live` or `fallback`). EUR/GBP rates now current.
- ✅ **SILQ Covenant monitoring** — 9th SILQ tab. Auto-checks 5 facility covenants from tape data: PAR30 ≤ 10% (5.5%), PAR90 ≤ 5% (1.4%), Collection Ratio > 33% (96.4% 3M avg), Repayment at Term > 95% (97.2%), LTV ≤ 75% (partial — needs corporate data). Values reconcile with Dec 2025 compliance certificate. Reuses `CovenantCard` + `ComplianceBadge` components.

## Known Gaps & Next Steps
**Completed:**
- [x] Onboard SILQ — POS lending asset class (3 products, multi-sheet loader, 9 tabs)
- [x] Add `core/analysis.py` unit tests (99 tests passing)
- [x] Replace hardcoded FX rates with live API
- [x] Startup script — `start.ps1` boots both servers + opens browser
- [x] Covenant monitoring alerts — auto-check PAR30, PAR90, Collection Ratio, Repayment at Term, LTV
- [x] Compliance cert reconciliation — verified against Dec 2025 cert and Jan 2026 Commentary
- [x] GBV-weighted PAR, DPD ref-date fix, backward-date caveat system
- [x] SILQ-specific Methodology page
- [x] Portfolio analytics computation engine — `core/portfolio.py` with auto-dispatch for SILQ and Klaim
- [x] Frontend portfolio tabs wired to real backend APIs (replaced mock data)
- [x] 6 portfolio API endpoints (borrowing base, concentration limits, covenants, flow, facility params)
- [x] Facility params persistence (corporate-level data saved as JSON)
**Short term (Tape Analytics):**
- [ ] SILQ Data Integrity tab — needs second tape for cross-tape consistency checks
- [ ] Facility params input UI panel (currently no frontend for editing facility params)
- [ ] Portfolio flow tab UI (backend endpoint exists, no frontend tab yet)
**Phase 2A — Database (not started):**
- [ ] PostgreSQL setup + schema (`organizations`, `invoices`, `payments`, `bank_statements`, `facility_config`)
- [ ] Migration of existing CSV tape data into database (for validation)
- [ ] JSONB metadata columns for company-specific fields (Klaim vs SILQ different schemas)
**Phase 2B — Integration API (not started):**
- [ ] Inbound API endpoints: `/api/integration/invoices` (CRUD + bulk), `/payments` (CRUD + bulk), `/bank-statements`
- [ ] X-API-Key authentication per organization
- [ ] Per-company field mappings via `facility_config` JSON
**Phase 2 Feature Gaps (not started):**
- [ ] Invoices page (eligible vs ineligible split, filterable/sortable, paginated)
- [ ] Payments page (transaction ledger with ADVANCE/PARTIAL/FINAL badges, invoice cross-reference)
- [ ] Bank Statements page (balance overview, historical chart, upload interface)
- [ ] Concentration breach drill-down (expandable limit cards with breaching items)
- [ ] Covenant historical date selector (query past reporting periods)

**SILQ Compliance Certificate — Extracted Formulas (Dec 2025 cert, reconciliation Excel at `Downloads/SILQ_KSA_Compliance_Reconciliation.xlsx`):**

| # | Covenant | Formula | Threshold | Cert Value | Computable from tape? |
|---|----------|---------|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Debt/Equity | Corporate-level | ≤ 3.0x | 1.2x | ❌ Off-tape |
| 2 | Min Cash Balance | Cash / max(month burn, 3m avg) | b > a | 57.8M > 21.1M | ❌ Off-tape |
| 3 | PAR 30 | GBV >30 DPD / GBV outstanding (active) | ≤ 10% | 1.6% | ✅ Already live |
| 4 | Collection Ratio | 3-month avg of (Repaid / Collectable) by maturity month | > 33% | 95.53% | ✅ Already live |
| 5 | Repayment at Term | Collections / GBV for loans maturing 3-6 months prior | > 95% | 97.33% | ✅ Already live |
| 6 | LTV | Facility outstanding / (Receivables + Cash) | ≤ 75% | 74.85% | ⚠️ Partial (receivables yes, facility/cash no) |

**Borrowing base waterfall (from cert):**
1. Total A/R = sum of outstanding for active loans (SAR 69.3M at Dec 31)
2. Ineligible = DPD>90 + concentration excess + age violations
3. Eligible = Total A/R − Ineligible
4. Advance rate discount (SILQ-specific rates TBD from facility agreement)
5. Borrowing Base = Eligible × Advance Rate

**Key reconciliation findings:**
- PAR30: Cert 1.6% (Dec 31) vs tape 5.5% (Jan 31) — increase due to one month aging, directionally consistent
- Collection Ratio: Cert 95.53% 3M avg — tape rates higher because extra month of collections occurred
- Repayment at Term: Cert 97.33% vs tape 96.86% — Δ 0.47pp, within expected tolerance
- LTV: 74.85%, only 15bps below 75% limit — tightest covenant, depends on cash injection
**Phase 3 (Deployment & Team Access):**
- [ ] Cloud deployment — Railway (~$5/mo), deploys from GitHub, auto-HTTPS. Add simple auth before exposing.
- [ ] Role-based access (analyst vs IC vs read-only)
- [ ] Scheduled report delivery
- [ ] Accounting reports upload (P&L, Balance Sheet PDFs from portfolio companies)
