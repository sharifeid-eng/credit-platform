## Completed — 2026-04-04 (this session)
- [x] Typography overhaul — Syne 800 (display/hero), Space Grotesk 400-700 (UI), JetBrains Mono (data). Single load point in index.html. All 55+ IBM Plex Mono / Inter references replaced with CSS tokens.
- [x] Islamic geometric background — SVG stroke widths tuned to be visible (1.0 lines, 1.6 star, 2.2 dots), opacity 14%, backgroundSize 140px.
- [x] Navbar enlarged 50% — height 56→80px, lion 36→54px, LAITH wordmark 22→33px. Syne font applied to wordmark. "Data Analytics" label 10→15px.
- [x] Section labels enlarged — "Portfolio Companies" and "Resources" 9→13px.
- [x] Per-company DataChat questions — `PROMPTS` map in DataChat.jsx keyed by `analysisType` (`silq`, `ejari_summary`, `default`). Relevant questions for each asset class.
- [x] Flag rendering fix — emoji flags (🇦🇪, 🇸🇦) don't render on Windows Chrome. Switched to flagcdn.com `<img>` tags using ISO country codes.
- [x] Collection rate bug fix — `summary.collection_rate` was already a percentage; multiplying ×100 showed 8500%. Fixed in CompanyCard and PortfolioStatsHero.
- [x] LandingCanvas removed from landing page — performance vs. complexity trade-off; geometric pattern provides ambient texture without JS overhead.
- [x] Two-banner stats strip — `PortfolioStatsHero.jsx` rebuilt as two stacked banners:
  - Banner 1 "Data Analyzed" (gold tint): live from `/aggregate-stats` — Face Value Analyzed, Records Processed, Snapshots Loaded, Portfolio Companies. Cached by snapshot fingerprint.
  - Banner 2 "Live Portfolio" (neutral): Active Exposure, PAR 30+, PAR 90+, Covenants in Breach, HHI — all `—` until real DB data connected.
  - `useCountUp` hook with ease-out expo animation; `Skeleton` shimmer during load.
- [x] `/aggregate-stats` backend endpoint — face value from latest snapshot only (no double-counting), total records from all snapshots, FX-normalised to USD (AED×0.2723, SAR×0.2667). File-based cache invalidated by snapshot fingerprint.

## Creative UI Redesign — Landing Page & Company Pages
**Status: COMPLETE — all phases + data-wiring done**

### Data-wiring (both complete)
- [x] **P4.1 — KPI delta indicators**: Previous snapshot summary fetched, δcoll / δdenial / δactive computed, passed as `trend` prop to Collection Rate, Denial Rate, Active Deals KPI cards.
- [x] **P4.4 — Sparkline data**: Collection velocity + deployment chart fetched in OverviewTab; last 6 monthly values extracted; passed as `sparklineData` to Purchase Value (deployment totals) and Collection Rate (monthly rate) KPI cards.
**Branch:** `claude/creative-landing-page-research-5hdf6`
**Goal:** Transform the landing page from a generic card grid into an institutional, MENA-identity-driven experience. Elevate company pages with richer data density and interaction.

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins: Landing Page Identity (no new libraries)

- [x] **P1.1 — Islamic geometric background pattern**
  - Create `frontend/public/geometric-pattern.svg` — a Girih/Mashrabiya tile pattern using gold (`#C9A84C`) on transparent, seamlessly tileable (~120px tile), 8-point star geometry
  - Apply as CSS `background-image` on Home.jsx at 4–5% opacity (zero runtime cost — pure SVG + CSS)

- [x] **P1.2 — Display serif font for hero text**
  - Add Playfair Display (Google Fonts) to `frontend/index.html` — weights 400, 700
  - Add `--font-display: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;` to `styles/tokens.css`
  - In Home.jsx, add hero headline above company grid: *"Institutional Credit Analytics"* in display serif, 48–56px, gold gradient text
  - Subtitle in Inter: *"Private credit portfolio intelligence for MENA asset-backed lending"*

- [x] **P1.3 — Aggregate portfolio stats hero strip**
  - New component `frontend/src/components/PortfolioStatsHero.jsx`
  - Fetches per-company `/summary` on mount, aggregates: Total Deployed, Weighted Collection Rate, Total Active Deals
  - Custom `useCountUp(target, duration)` hook using `requestAnimationFrame` (no library)
  - Layout: dark strip with gold top/bottom border lines, mono font stats, small-caps labels
  - Positioned between Navbar and the company grid

- [x] **P1.4 — Country/region identity on company cards**
  - Add country flag emoji + region label to CompanyCard (AED→🇦🇪 UAE, SAR→🇸🇦 KSA, USD→check config)
  - Add asset class label in small caps: "Healthcare Receivables", "POS Lending", "Rent Finance"
  - Show one headline metric prominently (collection rate % from summary endpoint)
  - Taller cards (min-height: 200px), more breathing room, less decoration

### Phase 2 — Cinematic Entrance & Card Elevation

- [x] **P2.1 — Hero typewriter effect**
  - `useTypewriter(text, speed)` hook — types subtitle character by character on load
  - Blinking cursor that fades after typing completes
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (shows full text instantly if reduced motion preferred)

- [x] **P2.2 — Logo draw-on entrance animation**
  - Landing page standalone logo: lion icon scale-pulse (CSS keyframe 0.3s)
  - "L"+"TH" fade in (0.2s) → "AI" gold glow (0.2s delay) — sequential reveal
  - Subtitle typewriter starts after logo sequence completes

- [x] **P2.3 — Company cards enhanced stagger + 3D hover**
  - Increase stagger to 80ms for more dramatic cascade
  - Add `rotateX: 2` + CSS `perspective: 800px` on hover for subtle 3D tilt
  - Gradient top border animates width 0%→100% on first appearance (not just hover)

### Phase 3 — Animated Canvas Background

- [x] **P3.1 — Canvas network animation**
  - New `frontend/src/components/LandingCanvas.jsx` — fixed `<canvas>` behind content (z-index: 0)
  - Pure Canvas API (no Three.js — keeps bundle lean):
    - Company nodes: larger, gold, pulsing sine-wave radius
    - Deal nodes: ~15 small, muted teal, Brownian drift with boundary bounce
    - Connecting lines: gold→teal gradient stroke at ~15% opacity, proximity-threshold based
  - 30fps throttled via `requestAnimationFrame` + frame counter
  - Pauses on hidden tab (`visibilityState`), resizes on window resize (debounced), cleanup on unmount

- [x] **P3.2 — Canvas ↔ card hover connection**
  - Shared `hoveredCompany` state: CompanyCard sets it on hover, LandingCanvas reads it
  - Hovered company's node glows brighter + emits expanding pulse ring (opacity fade-out)

### Phase 4 — Company Page Enhancements

- [x] **P4.1 — KPI card delta indicators**
  - Add optional `delta` + `deltaLabel` props to `KpiCard.jsx`
  - Render small pill below value: green ▲ / red ▼ with delta amount
  - Populate on Klaim Overview for: collection rate, active deals, total deployed (vs prior snapshot)
  - Frontend diff: call `/summary` for current + previous snapshot, compute deltas

- [x] **P4.2 — Sidebar active state animation**
  - Active left border: animate in via Framer Motion `scaleY` 0→1 (origin top, 150ms)
  - Active item: subtle gold gradient sweep left→right (5%→0% opacity background)
  - Hover: `translateX: 2px` micro-indent on non-active items

- [x] **P4.3 — Tab transition enhancement**
  - Add `filter: blur(4px)→blur(0)` on entering tab content
  - Increase y offset 8→12 for more cinematic feel
  - Switch from linear to `easeOut` spring easing

- [x] **P4.4 — Inline sparklines on KPI cards (stretch)**
  - New optional `sparklineData` prop on KpiCard — array of 6 values
  - Render as 40×20px inline SVG `<polyline>` with gold stroke, no axes
  - Populate on Overview KPIs that have natural time-series: collection rate, deployment volume
  - Data: last 6 points from existing chart endpoint arrays (pass through from TapeAnalytics)

### Phase 5 — Polish & Integration

- [x] **P5.1 — Dark mode consistency + performance pass**
  - Audit new components for hardcoded colors, replace with CSS tokens
  - Canvas: test on throttled CPU (Chrome DevTools); confirm no scroll jank
  - Adjust pattern opacity if needed for different brightness levels

- [x] **P5.2 — Responsive + accessibility**
  - Mobile breakpoints for hero strip, card redesign
  - Canvas disabled on mobile (`max-width: 768px`) — too battery intensive
  - Typewriter + entrance animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

- [x] **P5.3 — Commit, push, update CLAUDE.md**
  - Commit all to `claude/creative-landing-page-research-5hdf6`
  - Push to remote
  - Update CLAUDE.md: new components in structure, design decisions documented

## Completed — 2026-04-01
- [x] Fix PAR KPI card sizing inconsistency — PAR 30+ subtitle was longer than PAR 60+/90+, causing uneven heights. Standardized all to `{ccy} {amount}K at risk`
- [x] Fix dynamic grid reflow — PAR+DTFC grid used async-derived column count, causing layout shift when DTFC loaded. Fixed to `repeat(5, 1fr)`
- [x] Standardize Overview page structure across all companies — consistent sections: Main KPIs (L1/L2) → Credit Quality (L3, PAR cards) → Leading Indicators (L5, DTFC). Applied to Klaim, SILQ, Ejari
- [x] SILQ Overview refactor — extracted PAR30/PAR90 from inline KPIs into dedicated Credit Quality section with 3 individual cards. Added Overdue Rate and Completed Loans to main grid
- [x] Renamed Klaim sections — "Portfolio at Risk" → "Credit Quality", separated DTFC into "Leading Indicators" section
- [x] Added "Credit Quality" section header to Ejari Dashboard PAR cards
- [x] Added AI Executive Summary to Ejari — `_build_ejari_full_context()` builds 20 context lines from ODS workbook. Endpoint now handles `ejari_summary` analysis type
- [x] Decoupled Executive Summary from `hide_portfolio_tabs` — now always visible in sidebar

## Completed — 2026-03-31 (session 4)
- [x] CDR/CCR tab — `compute_cdr_ccr()` (Klaim) + `compute_silq_cdr_ccr()` (SILQ); annualizes cumulative rates by vintage age to strip out maturity effects; 4 KPI tiles, dual-line CDR/CCR chart, net spread line with per-point color; new tab for both Klaim (19th) and SILQ (13th)

  - Updated Data Quality Validation: added Anomaly Detection subsection documenting all 5 new checks

## Completed — 2026-03-31 (session 1)
- [x] Covenants: trigger distance + projected breach date
  - Backend: covenants endpoint loads previous snapshot, computes rate-of-change, adds `previous_value` + `days_since_previous` per covenant
  - Frontend CovenantCard: headroom line (teal ✓) when compliant, projected breach date (amber ⚠) when trend moving toward limit, ↘/↗ direction vs prior snapshot
